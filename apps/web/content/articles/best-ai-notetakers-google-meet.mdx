With millions of professionals using Google Meet daily, you'd expect Google to nail AI-powered meeting notes.

They tried with ["Take notes for me"](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/14754931) - automatic meeting notes powered by Gemini AI, organized in Google Docs. But it's only available to "a small group of users," requires expensive Workspace plans, works in just 8 languages, and often produces incomplete summaries.

Even with access, Google's native solution lacks advanced features teams actually need: speaker identification, customizable templates, CRM integrations, and privacy controls for sensitive conversations.

That's why we tested dozens of specialized [AI notetakers](/blog/best-ai-meeting-assistant-for-taking-notes) that work seamlessly with Google Meet while delivering the meeting intelligence that Google's native features can't match.

Here are our top picks:

- **Hyprnote**: Best for privacy-conscious organizations and professionals seeking complete data control.
- **Fireflies AI**: Best for teams needing comprehensive conversation analytics and multilingual support.
- **Sembly AI**: Best for teams needing automated deliverable generation and cross-meeting analytics
- **tl;dv**: Best for sales teams needing video analysis, coaching insights, and CRM automation
- **Tactiq**: Best for Chrome users wanting real-time transcription without installing separate apps
- **Krisp**: Best for teams in noisy environments who need both audio enhancement and meeting notes
- **Otter AI**: Best for users wanting familiar, mainstream AI transcription with team features

## What Are the Best AI Notetakers for Google Meet?

Let's look at a detailed review of each of the shortlisted AI notetakers.

### 1. Hyprnote: The Privacy-First AI Notepad

[Hyprnote](/) is the only truly [local-first AI notetaker](/product/local-ai) on this list. While other tools send your Google Meet audio to cloud servers for processing, Hyprnote keeps everything on your device giving you complete data control.

**Full Disclosure**: I'm the co-founder of Hyprnote, so I'll try to be as objective as possible in this review.

**How It Works with Google Meet**: Hyprnote doesn't join your Google Meet as a bot. Instead, it captures both your microphone input and your computer's system audio, so it naturally hears both sides of the conversation. It transcribes your call in real-time, and once the meeting ends, you get structured summaries with decisions and action items automatically extracted.

The interface feels like Apple Notes with AI superpowers running in the background. No bots to invite, no meeting links to manage, no wondering if the service is down.

#### Key Features

- Complete local processing using the custom HyperLLM-V1 model
- Real-time transcription using Whisper models from lightweight to highly accurate versions
- Universal platform compatibility works with Google Meet, Zoom, Teams, and in-person meetings
- Bot-free operation means no disruption to your meeting flow
- Multiple deployment options - keep everything on your device for maximum privacy, deploy on your own servers for compliance, or use cloud setup for convenience
- Smart consent management for Enterprises with multiple options from simple pop-ups to voice recognition that listens for verbal consent
- Open source codebase for security audits and customization
- Calendar integration with the notification system
- Conversational search across all meeting history

#### Strengths

- Maximum privacy; your data never leaves your device, making compliance simple
- No vendor lock-in since you can choose your preferred AI models and providers
- Free core functionality with transcription and basic summarization at no cost
- Works completely offline; perfect for air-gapped environments or poor connectivity

#### Considerations

- macOS only currently (Windows version coming soon)
- No video recording by design for maximum privacy
- Limited integrations compared to established cloud platforms
- Basic speaker identification currently distinguishes only between microphone and system audio

#### Pricing

Hyprnote is a [free AI notetaker](/blog/free-ai-notetakers), which means you'll likely never need to pay for Hyprnote's core features.

Consider upgrading to Pro ($8/month) only when you want unlimited everything and advanced features like custom templates.

Enterprise becomes relevant when your organization needs an on-premises deployment, SSO integration, or consent management for compliance requirements. [Contact sales for a quote](/founders).
