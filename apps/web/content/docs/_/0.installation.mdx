All releases are always available on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/releases).

## macOS

macOS is our main focus, especially Apple Silicon devices. The recommended way to install Hyprnote is via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask fastrepl/hyprnote/hyprnote@nightly
```

You can also download the DMG directly from the [download page](https://hyprnote.com/download).

After installation, open Hyprnote from your Applications folder. On first launch, macOS will ask for permission to access your microphone and system audio. Grant these permissions to enable transcription features.

## Linux

Linux support is experimental. You can find binaries on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/releases) page, or download the latest version directly:

- [AppImage (x86_64)](https://desktop2.hyprnote.com/download/latest/appimage-x86_64?channel=nightly)
- [Debian Package (x86_64)](https://desktop2.hyprnote.com/download/latest/deb-x86_64?channel=nightly)

For AppImage, make the file executable with `chmod +x` before running. For Debian-based distributions, install the `.deb` package with `sudo dpkg -i hyprnote.deb`.

## Windows

Windows support is coming in Q1 2026. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyprnote) to stay updated.
