## Base

There is two type of base directories. `global` and `vault`.

### Global

- Shared between `stable` and `nightly` builds. (`staging` and `dev` builds use different folders).
- `models/`, `store.json`, `hyprnote.json` are stored here.

### Vault

- Customizable, defaults to be the same as `global` base, for backward compatibility.
- Contents like `sessions/`, `humans/`, `organizations/`, `chats/`, `prompts/`, and configs like `settings.json` are stored here.
