## The Founders

**Jeeheon "John" Jeong**: Product design and sales background. Passionate about simplicity, industrial design, and thoughtful UX. Believes in products that remove friction rather than add it.

**Yujong Lee**: Open-source engineer, contributor to projects like Hono and LiteLLM. Systems thinker who goes deep into fundamentals, ensuring robust, scalable architecture.

## Shared Values

We've worked together for years, and though our backgrounds are different, our strength is shared values: we care about craft, simplicity, and building things that people truly want to use.
