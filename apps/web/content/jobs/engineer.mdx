## not

This might **NOT** be a good fit if:

- You don't care about UI polish
- You need specs to start working
- You don't like code review
- You skip quality to move fast
- You don't use AI tools
- You want a short-term role

## why

Hyprnote is product-led. Engineering execution is our bottleneck - code quality depends too much on the founder. We need someone to own quality across the stack and act as first-line reviewer.

Some context: 7.4k GitHub stars, 9.2% conversion rate, 50k app downloads, 30% WoW DAU growth, 38% week-5 retention, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

## what

Own code quality across desktop and web. Build features end-to-end with Tauri, Rust, and TypeScript. Act as first-line reviewer. Ensure UI polish. Use AI tools to move faster.

Success: the app feels stable and polished, founder review time drops, code reviews feel obvious.

## who

An engineer who cares about user experience. Fast, independent, uncompromising on code quality and UI polish. Experienced with Tauri, Rust, and TypeScript. Comfortable with AI tools. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## how

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack, occasional calls. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.

<ToolStack tools={["tauri", "rust", "typescript"]} />

<EditorStack tools={["zed", "cursor"]} />

<AIToolStack tools={["claude", "devin"]} />

<GitToolStack tools={["graphite", "gitbutler"]} />

## compensation

Ballpark: $100–150k/year, 0.5–1.5% equity. Depends on scope and experience.

Early, high-ownership role. You'll grow with the company.
