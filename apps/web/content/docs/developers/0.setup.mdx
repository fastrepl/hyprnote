Char uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) for most development tasks. See `**/Taskfile.yaml` for available commands.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Char, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v9 or later)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation)

## Mac

Install the required system dependencies via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake pkg-config
```

Install Rust if you haven't already:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/char.git
cd char

pnpm install
```

Build the UI package before running the desktop app:

```bash
pnpm -F ui build
```

### macOS Permissions for Development

When running Char in development mode, macOS requires you to grant permissions to the terminal application you're using to build and run the app (e.g., Terminal, iTerm2, VS Code, Warp). This is different from the production app, where permissions are granted directly to Char.

Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and grant the following permissions to your terminal application:

**Microphone**: Required for audio capture during development. Without this, the app won't be able to record from your microphone.

**Accessibility**: Required for certain system-level features. Your terminal needs accessibility access to allow the development build to interact with system APIs.

If you're using VS Code's integrated terminal, you'll need to grant these permissions to Visual Studio Code. For standalone terminals like iTerm2 or the default Terminal app, grant permissions to those applications instead.

After granting permissions, you may need to restart your terminal or IDE for the changes to take effect.

## Linux

For Ubuntu-based distributions, run the setup script:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-linux.sh
```

This script installs all required system dependencies including GTK, PulseAudio, and Tauri prerequisites. It also installs development tools like dprint, Taskfile, and Supabase CLI.

After running the setup script, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/char.git
cd char
pnpm install
```
