At Hyprnote, our way of working is designed to maximize focus, creativity, and speed. Each founder has a different style, and we embrace that diversity to get the best out of ourselves.

## Individual Styles

**John** works best when in motion, shifting between spaces — coffee shops, parks, different environments. Moving helps reset focus, and speaking ideas aloud (almost like talking to someone) is part of his creative process.

**Yujong** thrives in calm, ordered environments where he can achieve deep focus and think through systems at the root level.

**Duck** prefers structure and used to maintain an office commute for better concentration, showing that physical separation helps him be fully engaged at work.

## Our Culture

Our culture acknowledges these differences. Productivity comes not from forcing uniformity, but from creating conditions where each person can deliver their best.
