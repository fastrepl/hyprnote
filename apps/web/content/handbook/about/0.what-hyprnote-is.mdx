## Beyond Note-Taking

Note-taking reduces cognitive load. We're extending that idea: what other cognitive burdens can we offload? Today it's notes. Tomorrow, email, calendar, and broader workflow — an AI-native executive assistant that actually works for you.

Hyprnote combines two capabilities: **AI notetaking** (the foundation — capturing and understanding meetings) and **AI assistant** (the superpower — taking action on that understanding). Learn more in [Product Philosophy](/company-handbook/about/product-philosophy/).

## Your AI, Your Way

- Use on-device models for complete privacy
- Bring any AI model — cloud or local
- Own your data completely
- No vendor lock-in

Like Apple Notes, but built for meetings. Like an assistant that records, understands, and organizes — on your terms.
