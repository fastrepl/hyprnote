## Why this is created?

Although we aim to be **fully transparent & controllable,**

1. The time-to-value can be too long for some users.
2. Although someone wants controllability, it doesn't mean they want to manage everything.

## Is it safe?

- The server (`pro.hyprnote.com`) is [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/tree/main/apps/pro) and deployed in our K8S cluster in AWS via GitHub Actions.
- Nothing is stored by us. If we use any third-party service, only required data are sent to it.
  - We use `Anthropic`, `Exa`, and `Jina AI` at the moment.
