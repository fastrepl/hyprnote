Pro includes access to premium cloud transcription services that offer higher accuracy than local models, especially for accented speech, technical jargon, and noisy environments.

## How to Enable

1. Activate your Pro license in Settings
2. Go to Settings > Transcription
3. Select a cloud provider (Deepgram or AssemblyAI recommended)

The Pro cloud endpoint handles API keys automatically - no additional configuration needed.

## When to Use Cloud vs Local

Use cloud transcription when you need maximum accuracy and have internet access. Use local transcription when privacy is paramount or you're offline.
