One source of truth, open to everyone. Early on we had too many channels. Now GitHub is primary, everything syncs into it.

## GitHub Structure

- **Discussions** — Feedback requests, feature conversations
- **Issues** — Bug reports, tracked work
- **Projects** — Prioritization, operational board ([link](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6))

**content-collections** powers roadmaps, blog, and docs — all in one ecosystem.
