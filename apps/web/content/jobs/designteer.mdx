## You won't get along with us

- If you only want to design in Figma
- If you prefer mockups over shipping
- If you can't write production code
- If you skip quality to move fast
- If you need process to make progress
- If you don't want to do marketing
- If you want a short-term role

## Why we need your help

Hyprnote is product-led. Design execution is our bottleneck - visual quality depends too much on the founder. **We need someone to own design across product and marketing.**

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

## What you'll be doing

Own visual quality across product, website, and marketing. Design and implement real UI in code. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used.

Success: the product feels calmer + more solid, marketing doesn't wait on the founder, design decisions feel obvious.

## Who we want to meet

A design engineer who ships. You design in Figma, then build it yourself in React. Fast, independent, uncompromising on quality. Interested in marketing and storytelling. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## How we work

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on.

You must be comfortable with <ToolIcon icon="logos:figma" /> Figma, <ToolIcon icon="logos:react" /> React, <ToolIcon icon="logos:tailwindcss-icon" /> Tailwind, and basic video editing.

You will work directly with <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> and <GitHubMention username="harshikaalagh-netizen" name="Harshika" />.

3. 30-min follow-up: We'll ask a bunch of questions, but don't hesitate to ask us too! We love questions and want to discuss things together. After all, this is a startup and lots of stuff needs to be figured out.
4. Take-home assignment: You'll have a week to propose a solution to a design problem. These are practical challenges like designing a landing page or a new settings tab for our desktop app - real issues on our mind. They're all open-ended, and some don't even have a low-fidelity design yet. It's up to you to figure out the best approach.
