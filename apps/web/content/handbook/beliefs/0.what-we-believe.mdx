summary: "The core convictions that shape everything we build."

Not marketing slogans. Convictions we return to when making hard decisions.

**Files Endure, Interfaces Change** — The filesystem isn't a relic — it's how humans organize information. Location is recall. Structure is memory. Your notes should survive us.

**Ownership Over Convenience** — A note-taking system is a memory prosthetic. Memory needs to feel owned. Files on your disk, not opaque blobs behind an API.

**Compatibility Over Dominance** — We don't want to be the only tool you use. Best at meeting notes, speaks the same language as everything else. Plain text makes this possible.

**Durability Over Trendiness** — Technologies that last decades, not ones popular this quarter. Local-first, Git-backed. Fast for humans, safe for decades.

**Transparency Creates Trust** — Open source isn't marketing. It's being inspectable. See how it works, trust it. Modify it, own it.
