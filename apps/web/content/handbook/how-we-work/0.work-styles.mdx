Remote-first. Async by default. Monthly in-person planning, otherwise work from wherever you do your best thinking.

We embrace that everyone has a different style:

**John** — Nocturnal. Moves between coffee shops and different environments. Cardio in morning, weights at night. Organized flexibility.

**Yujong** — Anti-nocturnal. Wakes early, sleeps early. Calm, ordered environments for deep focus and systems thinking.

Productivity comes from creating conditions where each person delivers their best, not from forcing uniformity. If you join, we'll figure out what works for you — the only thing we care about is output and craft.
