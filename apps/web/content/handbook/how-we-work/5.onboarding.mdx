## First Steps

1. Get added to the [GitHub organization](https://github.com/fastrepl) and the [hyprnote repo](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote)
2. Read through this handbook — start with [What Hyprnote Is](/handbook/about/what-hyprnote-is), [Design Philosophy](/handbook/beliefs/design-philosophy), and [Product Philosophy](/handbook/about/product-philosophy)
3. Download a [staging build](#downloading-staging-builds) and use the app yourself
4. Set up your local development environment (see below)

## Development Environment

### Editor

If you don't have a specific preference, we recommend using [Cursor](https://cursor.com). It has good AI-assisted editing and works well with our codebase.

- [Visual Editor intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOtHjA8THCw) — useful for learning Cursor basics

### Repository Setup

Follow the [developer setup guide](/docs/developers/setup) for full instructions. The short version:

**Mac:**

```bash
brew install cmake pkg-config
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote.git
cd hyprnote
pnpm install
pnpm -F ui build
```

**Linux:**

```bash
bash scripts/setup-linux.sh
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote.git
cd hyprnote
pnpm install
```

See [Environment Variables](/docs/developers/env) for configuration, and [Run](/docs/developers/run) for starting the dev server.

### Troubleshooting

If Cursor cannot connect to the network when indexing the repo, try:

- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Restart Cursor and re-open the project
- If the issue persists, you can still work by browsing the code directly — the project structure is documented in the [developer docs](/docs/developers/setup)

## For Designers

Design work at Hyprnote lives close to the code. You don't need to be a full-stack engineer, but understanding the project structure helps you contribute effectively.

### What to Explore First

- **Use the app** — Download a staging build and use Hyprnote for your own meetings. The best design intuition comes from being a real user
- **Read the codebase** — Browse `apps/desktop/src/components/` to see how the UI is structured. The frontend is React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Look at the UI library** — `packages/ui/` contains shared components built on [Radix](https://www.radix-ui.com/) and styled with Tailwind

### Design-to-Code Workflow

We use [Figma](https://figma.com) for design exploration and prototyping. The workflow:

1. **Explore in Figma** — Use Figma (or Figma Make) to prototype ideas and iterate on static layouts
2. **Share designs** — Post screenshots or Figma links in Slack for feedback
3. **Implement in code** — Translate approved designs into React components. Use the existing component patterns in `packages/ui/` and `apps/desktop/src/components/`
4. **Open a PR** — All changes go through pull requests on GitHub for review

### Key Directories for UI Work

- `apps/desktop/src/components/` — Desktop app UI components
- `apps/web/src/` — Marketing website and docs
- `packages/ui/` — Shared component library (buttons, cards, dialogs, etc.)
- `extensions/` — Extension panels with their own React UIs
- `apps/web/content/` — MDX content for docs, handbook, blog, etc.

### Content and Docs

All written content (handbook, docs, blog posts) lives as MDX files in `apps/web/content/`. See the [CMS page](/handbook/how-we-work/cms) for how this works. You can contribute to docs and content by editing these files directly and opening a PR.

## Downloading Staging Builds

Staging builds are created when testing new features before they go to nightly or stable releases. The easiest way to download the latest staging build is using the dedicated workflow:

1. Go to the [Download Latest Staging Build workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/download_staging.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the platform (currently `macos-aarch64` for Apple Silicon Macs)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Once complete, download the artifact from the workflow run

Staging builds are stored in R2 with filenames like `hyprnote-staging-{timestamp}-{commit}-macos-aarch64.dmg`, making it easy to identify which commit a build corresponds to.

You can also download directly from the desktop_cd workflow artifacts:

1. Go to the [desktop_cd workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Find the staging build run you want
3. Download `hyprnote-staging-macos-silicon` from the Artifacts section

## Triggering Staging Builds

To trigger a staging build for a PR or branch:

1. Comment `/staging` on the PR
2. The bot will trigger a staging build and reply with a link to the workflow run
3. Once complete, use the download workflow or artifacts to get the build

You can also trigger a staging build manually:

1. Go to [desktop_cd.yaml workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch and choose "staging" as the channel
4. Click "Run workflow"
