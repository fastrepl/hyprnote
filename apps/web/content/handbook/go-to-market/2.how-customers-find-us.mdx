Build in public, let work speak for itself. People choose us for two reasons: high intent (actively searching) or trust (someone recommended us).

## Discovery Channels

**High-intent** — SEO, Reddit, LinkedIn. People actively searching for solutions.

**Social proof** — X, TikTok, word of mouth. Trust from respected voices.

**Organic** — Open source presence, GitHub, personal recommendations.

Both matter. We invest in maintaining presence across both.
