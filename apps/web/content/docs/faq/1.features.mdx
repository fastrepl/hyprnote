## What apps does Hyprnote work with?

Hyprnote works with any application on your computer - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, and more. It captures system audio, so it doesn't depend on specific integrations.

## Can I record in-person conversations?

Yes! Hyprnote captures your microphone input, so you can record in-person meetings, phone calls, or any conversation where you're using your computer's microphone.

## What languages does Hyprnote support?

Hyprnote supports transcription and AI features in 45+ languages including:

**Major Languages:**

- English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean

**European Languages:**

- Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Romanian, Czech, Slovak, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Greek, Danish, Ukrainian, Turkish

**Other Languages:**

- Arabic, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, Tamil, Hindi, Hebrew, Azerbaijani, Catalan, Galician, Macedonian, Bosnian, Estonian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian

You can select your main language and add additional spoken languages in the app's settings under "Language & Vocabulary". The main language is used for summaries, chats, and AI-generated responses, while spoken languages help improve transcription accuracy when multiple languages are used in a meeting. See [Better Transcription](/docs/pro/better-transcription) for provider language support details.

## Do my pinned tabs persist across restarts?

Yes. Pinned tabs are saved automatically and restored when you relaunch Hyprnote, so your workspace stays the way you left it.

## Can I set my timezone manually?

Yes. Go to **Settings** > **General** and use the timezone dropdown to override the automatically detected timezone. This affects how session timestamps are displayed in the sidebar timeline.

## Can I mention other notes or contacts in my notes?

Yes! Hyprnote supports backlink mentions. Type `@` in a note to search for and link to other notes, people, or companies. Mentions are displayed as clickable tags that navigate to the referenced item.

## Can I search across all my notes?

Yes. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> to open the Advanced Search tab, which lets you search across all sessions with filters by type (meeting notes, people, organizations) and date range (today, this week, this month). Results highlight matching text in context.

## What views does the calendar support?

The calendar tab (<kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>) supports week, 3-day, and day views. You can switch between them using the controls at the top of the calendar. Events display inline with time slots, and clicking an event opens a popover where you can create a session from it. See [Calendar](/docs/calendar/apple) for setup instructions.

## Can I unignore a calendar event?

Yes. If you previously ignored a calendar event, right-click on it in the sidebar timeline and select "Unignore" from the context menu to restore it.

## Can I undo deleting a note?

Yes! When you delete a note, a toast notification appears giving you a few seconds to undo the deletion. You can also press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> to restore the most recently deleted note before the undo window expires.
