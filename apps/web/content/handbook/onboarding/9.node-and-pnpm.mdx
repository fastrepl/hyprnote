summary: "Install Node.js and pnpm — the JavaScript runtime and package manager the project depends on."
---

## What They Are

**[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** is a JavaScript runtime. Our website, docs, and desktop app frontend all run on JavaScript — Node.js is what executes it on your machine.

**[pnpm](https://pnpm.io)** is a package manager for JavaScript. When the project needs external libraries (and it needs hundreds), pnpm downloads and manages them. It's similar to npm but faster and more efficient.

You need both installed even if you never write JavaScript. Building the website, running the dev server, and previewing content changes all require them.

## Prerequisites

- [Homebrew](/handbook/onboarding/homebrew) installed

## Install Node.js

```bash
brew install node
```

Verify:

```bash
node --version
```

You should see `v20.x.x` or higher.

## Install pnpm

```bash
brew install pnpm
```

Verify:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

You should see `9.x.x` or higher.

## Install Project Dependencies

Once both are installed, navigate to the Char repo and install all project dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/Dev/hyprnote
pnpm install
```

This downloads everything the project needs. It takes a minute or two the first time.

## When You'll Use These

You won't run `node` or `pnpm` commands constantly, but they're behind the scenes for:

- `pnpm -F desktop tauri dev` — Run the desktop app locally
- `pnpm -F web dev` — Run the website locally to preview content changes
- `pnpm install` — Run this after pulling new changes that update dependencies

Most of these commands are wrapped in Taskfile commands, so you'll often just run `task <something>` instead. But Node.js and pnpm need to be installed for any of it to work.

## Troubleshooting

**"node: command not found"** — Close and reopen your terminal after installing. If it still doesn't work, run `brew link node`.

**"pnpm: command not found"** — Same fix — close and reopen your terminal, or run `brew link pnpm`.

**"pnpm install" fails with permission errors** — Don't use `sudo`. If you get permission errors, the issue is usually with your Node.js installation. Reinstall Node.js via Homebrew.
