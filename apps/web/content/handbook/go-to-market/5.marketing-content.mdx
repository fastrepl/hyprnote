Marketing planning lives in [fastrepl/marketing](https://github.com/fastrepl/marketing). Using GitHub keeps everything in one place and aligns with our values of openness.

## Why GitHub for Marketing

- **Single source of truth** — All content ideas, drafts, and feedback in one place
- **Collaboration** — Comment threads, reviews, and assignments work the same as code
- **Visibility** — Anyone on the team can see what's planned and in progress
- **History** — Every decision and iteration is tracked

## Content Types

We track different content types using a custom field in GitHub Projects:

- **YouTube** — Video content, tutorials, product demos
- **Blog** — Long-form articles, technical deep-dives
- **LinkedIn** — Professional updates, company news
- **Twitter/X** — Quick updates, engagement posts
- **Other** — Podcasts, newsletters, partnerships

## Workflow

Each piece of content starts as a GitHub Issue and moves through: **Idea** → **In Progress** → **Review** → **Published**.

Use issue comments for feedback. Tag team members for review. Link related issues when content builds on previous work.
