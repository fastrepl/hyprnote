```bash
open -a "Hyprnote Staging" --args --onboarding $(date +%s)
```

This will:

- Remove `settings.json` and `store.json`
- Reset all permissions

The timestamp is used to detect fresh launches vs relaunches (e.g., during permission setup).
If the timestamp is older than 2.5 seconds, it's treated as a restart and `--onboarding` will be ignored.
