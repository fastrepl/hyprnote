import Counter from "../components/Counter.tsx";

# How To

Welcome to the Hyprnote How To guide.

## Interactive Example

Here's an interactive React component rendered within this MDX page:

<Counter client:load />

## Getting Started

This is a simple single-page app built with:

- **Astro** - The web framework for content-driven websites
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX support
- **React** - For interactive components
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **Netlify** - For deployment

## Next Steps

Add your content here. You can use standard Markdown syntax, and embed React components anywhere in the document.
