When you're preparing for a meeting, that means you're likely a facilitator. Normally, you would write down the agenda and desired output somewhere else — on paper, in Apple Notes, in Obsidian, ... you name it.

But with Hyprnote you can just write stuff down like this.

What’s great about Hyprnote is that it skips these notes when making a summary — they’re just guidelines, not key info. And if something _should_ be included, chances are you said it out loud during the meeting anyway.
