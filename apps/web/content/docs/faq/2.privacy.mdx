## Where is my data stored?

All your recordings and notes are stored locally on your device. Char doesn't send your audio or transcripts to external servers. Everything is processed on-device using local AI.

## Is my data encrypted?

Yes, all your data is encrypted at rest on your device. Your recordings, transcripts, and notes are protected with industry-standard encryption.

## Can my employer see my Char recordings?

No. Char stores everything locally on your device. Unless you explicitly share your notes or recordings, they remain private to you.
