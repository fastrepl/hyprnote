## How do I get help if something isn't working?

The fastest way to get help is through the **in-app support chat**. Click your profile icon in the sidebar and select **Report Bug** or **Suggest Feature** to open a support conversation. The chat can search existing GitHub issues, create new issues, or add comments to existing ones. It also supports billing inquiries — you can check your subscription status or open the billing portal directly from the chat. Destructive actions (like creating an issue) require your confirmation before executing.

You can also reach us through our Discord community or by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/issues).

## Do you offer refunds?

Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with Char Pro, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.
