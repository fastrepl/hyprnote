Inspired by sites like [loggingsucks.com](https://loggingsucks.com) and [isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com](https://www.isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com/).

## What is this?

This is a humorous, tongue-in-cheek marketing page that highlights the universal pain of bad meetings. It uses dark humor and relatable office scenarios to make a point about how meetings are fundamentally broken, while promoting Hyprnote as a solution.

The page covers:

- Why meetings feel like "performance art depicting the slow heat death of productivity"
- A painfully accurate timeline of what actually happens in meetings
- Why traditional note-taking doesn't solve the problem
- How AI-powered context capture can make meetings actually useful
