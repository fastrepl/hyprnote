## Keychain Password Prompts (macOS)

If you see repeated password prompts asking for access to keychain items like `com.hyprnote.Argmax.licenseToken` or similar entries, this is typically caused by outdated or corrupted keychain entries from a previous version of Char.

### How to Fix

1. Open **Keychain Access** directly by searching "Keychain Access" in Spotlight and selecting the app (not the Passwords app that macOS may suggest). You can also find it at `/System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Keychain Access.app`.
2. In the search bar, type `hyprnote` or `argmax`
3. Select and delete any Char or Argmax related entries
4. Quit Char completely and relaunch the app

The app will create fresh keychain entries on the next launch, and the password prompts should stop appearing.

### If Deletion Doesn't Work

Keychain Access may sometimes ignore delete attempts for application password entries due to access control settings. If clicking Delete does nothing or no confirmation dialog appears:

1. Quit both Keychain Access and Char completely
2. Reopen Keychain Access and try deleting the entries again
3. When working correctly, you should see a confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to delete..."

If issues persist, you may need to restart your Mac to refresh the keychain state.

### Why This Happens

When Char updates, sometimes the code signing identity changes, which can cause macOS to treat the new version as a different application. This triggers keychain access prompts because macOS is protecting your stored credentials from unauthorized access.
