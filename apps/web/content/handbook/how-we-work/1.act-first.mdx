There's an irony we lean into: we're a meeting notes company that doesn't want you in meetings. Our product exists to reduce the suffering of meetings, not to create more of them. We want to create value, not have endless discussions about creating value.

## PRs Over Meetings

The default unit of work at Char is a pull request, not a meeting. Figure out what's important, act on it, then report back via a PR or a GitHub issue. Your teammates can review async. This is faster, leaves a paper trail, and respects everyone's focus time.

If you see something broken, fix it. If you have an idea, prototype it. If you disagree with a decision, propose a change. The bias is always toward action.

## Two Ways to Contribute

Every team member should feel like they're directly contributing to the business in one of two ways:

**Build the product** — Focus on activation and retention. Make Char so good that people can't stop using it. The user journey from first open to daily habit should be seamless.

**Get people to the product** — Focus on awareness and acquisition. Get the right people in front of Char, then make the website and onboarding experience convert them.

Both paths converge on the same thing: creating a great, consolidated user journey. Everything we do should be streamlined for the person using our product.

## Autonomous, Not Isolated

We don't want a lot of meetings, but we also don't want people working in the dark. The balance:

- **Act first** — Don't wait for permission. Ship something, then get feedback.
- **Report back** — PRs, GitHub issues, and Slack updates keep everyone in the loop.
- **Discuss when stuck** — Huddles and quick Slack calls for when async isn't cutting it. Keep them short.

Since we're open source and everything lives on GitHub, your work is visible by default. That's the accountability mechanism — not standups.
