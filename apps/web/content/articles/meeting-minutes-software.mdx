You've been in that meeting where someone's furiously typing while everyone else is trying to have an actual conversation. Or worse, you're the one stuck taking notes instead of contributing ideas. Well, meeting minutes software are here to change that.

There are essentially two types of meeting minute software:

**1. [AI Meeting Assistants](/blog/best-ai-meeting-assistant-for-taking-notes)** = Automatic transcription + AI summaries + minimal manual work

These tools use artificial intelligence to automatically record, transcribe, and summarize your meetings.

They listen to conversations, identify speakers, extract action items, and generate formatted notes with minimal human intervention.

**2. Meeting Management Tools** = Structured templates + manual note-taking + formal documentation workflows

These platforms provide structured frameworks for creating meeting minutes manually. They excel at formal documentation, governance workflows, and collaborative agenda building.

Ideal for board meetings and compliance-heavy environments.

Let's explore the top tools in both these categories.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Do I need AI meeting minutes software if I already take notes manually?

It depends on your priorities. AI tools save significant time by automating transcription and summary generation, letting you focus on the conversation instead of note-taking.

However, if you need formal documentation workflows, approval processes, or governance features for board meetings, manual software might be better suited to your needs.

### 2. Are AI meeting minutes tools secure for sensitive conversations?

It varies dramatically by tool. Most AI meeting assistants (MeetGeek, Fellow) send your audio to the cloud for processing, which may violate compliance requirements in healthcare, legal, or financial industries.

Hyprnote is the only truly local-first option that processes everything on your device, perfect for sensitive meetings.

### 3. Will a bot join my meetings if I use AI meeting minutes software?

It depends on the tool. Bot-based tools like MeetGeek and Fellow join meetings as visible participants, which can affect conversation dynamics in sensitive discussions.

[Bot-free meeting assistants](/blog/bot-free-ai-meeting-assistants) like Hyprnote capture audio directly from your device without appearing in the meeting, maintaining natural conversation flow.

Consider whether bot visibility matters for your use case before choosing.
