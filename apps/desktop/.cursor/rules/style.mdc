## Code Commebts

- By default, avoid writing comments at all.
- If you write one, it should be about "Why", not "What".

## Tailwind ClassNames

- If there are many classNames and they have conditional logic, use `cn` (import it with `import { cn } from "@hypr/utils"`). It is similar to `clsx`. Always pass an array. Split by logical grouping.
