Focused cycles. Structure with flexibility.

## Stable vs Nightly

**Stable** — Polished, user-facing. Each release should make the app "sticky" with genuine improvement.

**Nightly** — Internal testing, rapid iteration.

## Cadence

Monthly in-person planning. Define focus and outcomes for next stable. Kanban-style board in GitHub Projects gives visibility.

Weekly sprints within larger cycles. Clear requirements and deliverables.

## Principles

- **One core feature per stable** — Anchor each release with one significant improvement
- **Habit loop focus** — Make Hyprnote indispensable before expanding
- **Huddles for discussion** — Real-time collaboration over lengthy async threads
- **Ship and iterate** — Good and shipped beats waiting for perfect
