We balance independence with frequent sync. Too much disturbance kills focus; too little sync causes drift. To stay aligned, we use:

## Our Tools

**Slack** for day-to-day communication.

**Devin** as our AI software engineer. We have a dedicated product-with-devin channel in Slack where we transparently assign tasks and collaborate. We treat Devin like a colleague or intern — sometimes Yujong takes over when deeper coding expertise is needed, but mostly it's a transparent workflow where anyone can see what's being worked on.

**GitHub** as our single source of truth for product development and feedback. We also use it as a CMS — our IDEs double as blog editors. Want to write something? Just submit a PR with your article. Related posts:

**Development tools** — Zed, GitButler, Cursor, and Claude Code.

## AI-Augmented Team

We're automating as much as possible with AI and Hyprnote. Yujong has been heavily adopting AI into his workflow, and we believe a small, mission-aligned team augmented with AI can outperform companies with hundreds of people.
