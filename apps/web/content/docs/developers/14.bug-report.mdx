## Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any issues with Char, we'd love to hear about them! You can report bugs through:

- **In-app support chat**: Click your profile icon in the sidebar and select **Report Bug** or **Suggest Feature**. This opens a support chat that automatically collects device information and submits issues on your behalf.
- **GitHub Issues**: [github.com/fastrepl/char/issues](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/issues)
- **Discord**: Join our community for quick support and discussion

The in-app support chat is the recommended way to report bugs because it automatically attaches your platform, OS version, and app version to the report.

When reporting a bug manually, please include:

- Your operating system and version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Any error messages you see
- Relevant logs (see below for log locations)

## Finding Log Files

Char stores logs in platform-specific directories following XDG Base Directory conventions. These logs contain detailed information about application events and can help diagnose issues.

### macOS

```bash
~/Library/Logs/hyprnote/
```

The logs directory contains rolling daily logs with timestamped filenames, allowing you to review historical application events.

### Windows

```bash
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\hyprnote\logs
```

### Linux

```bash
~/.local/share/hyprnote/logs/
```

or

```bash
~/.config/hyprnote/logs/
```

## Application Data Locations

If you need to inspect or back up your application data, here's where Char stores various files:

### macOS

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/
├── db.sqlite              # User database
├── config.json            # App configuration
├── models/                # Downloaded AI models
│   ├── stt/              # Speech-to-text models
│   └── llm/              # Language models
└── sessions/             # Session recordings
```

### Windows

```bash
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\hyprnote\
```

### Linux

```bash
~/.local/share/hyprnote/
```

## Debugging Tips

### Frontend Issues

If you're experiencing UI-related problems:

1. Open Developer Tools (View → Toggle Developer Tools)
2. Check the Console tab for JavaScript errors
3. Check the Network tab for failed requests

### Backend Issues

For deeper investigation of backend problems:

1. Check the log files in the locations above
2. Look for error messages or stack traces
3. Note the timestamps of when issues occurred

### Performance Issues

If Char is running slowly:

1. Check log files for any repeated errors
2. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk usage)
3. Check if large models are being loaded
4. Review session recordings for unusually large files

## Common Issues

### Cannot Find Logs

If the logs directory doesn't exist, it may mean:

- Char hasn't been launched yet
- Permissions prevent directory creation
- The app is using a different data directory

### Clearing Old Data

To free up space, you can safely delete:

- Old log files from the logs directory
- Old session recordings from the sessions directory

Do **not** delete:

- `db.sqlite` (contains your notes and data)
- `config.json` (contains your settings)
- Model files (unless you want to re-download them)
