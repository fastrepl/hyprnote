## How to use

### How do I activate AI Chat?

You can open the chat panel by clicking the chat button next to the transcript button, or the chat button located in your note header.

Once opened, it’s very intuitive. Just type in anything you’d like the AI to do for you.

### I'm confused. What’s the scope of the chat window?

For now, the chat you open while viewing a specific note will focus on that note. We don’t yet support a Global Chat (a space where you can ask about any note or data across the app, similar to what Cursor offers).

That’s why each chat panel tied to a different note will start as a blank conversation. However, this doesn’t mean you’re limited to discussing just that one note. You can ask the chat about other notes or people by directly mentioning them in your message.

Keep in mind that the main context of the conversation will still be the note you’re currently viewing. For more on this, check out the sections below:\
_<u>Ask about a specific person or a note</u>_ and _<u>Ask about general knowledge across all your notes.</u>_

### Create multiple conversations

If your current conversation gets too long, you can start a new one in the same chat panel by clicking the "\+" floating button. You can also revisit previous chats by clicking the clock icon.

When a conversation becomes too lengthy, the AI might start producing inaccurate or buggy responses. We recommend starting a new conversation in those cases.

## Usecases

### Rewriting summaries

You can ask the AI to rewrite summaries in a different style or tone. Try prompts like:

- "Rewrite this summary into a concise one-paragraph version."
- "Draft a follow-up email for this meeting."
- "Add more direct quotes from the transcript to the summary."

### Meeting recap

If the meeting was long or packed with complex discussions, use AI Chat to help you digest the key points.

Example questions:

- "What are my action items?"
- "What exactly did Richard say about installing more servers?"

### Ask about a specific person or a note

If you want to recall details about someone you spoke with or revisit a past meeting, type "@" in the chat input to mention them.

Mentioned people or notes will be included in the chat’s context, so the AI can help you remember without needing to search manually.

### Ask about general knowledge acrros all your notes

<Info>
  General search through tool-calling is only supported with gpt-4.1, gpt-4o,
  claude 4 sonnet for now.
</Info>

Currently, general search using tool-calling is supported with GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Claude 4 Sonnet.

Even if you’re unsure what to ask, don’t worry. You can type general or broad questions, and Hyprnote AI Chat will automatically search through your meeting notes to find the most relevant information.

Example prompts:

- "Bring up notes related to product."
- "Search for notes about the Pied Piper deal."
- "Tell me everything about Richard Hendricks."
