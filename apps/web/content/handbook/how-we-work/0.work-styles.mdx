Maximize focus, creativity, and speed. We work from anywhere and embrace that each founder has a different style. Monthly in-person planning, otherwise remote.

**John** — Nocturnal, moves between coffee shops and different environments. Cardio in morning, weights at night. Organized flexibility.

**Yujong** — Anti-nocturnal. Wakes early, sleeps early. Calm, ordered environments for deep focus and systems thinking.

Productivity comes not from forcing uniformity, but from creating conditions where each person delivers their best.
