## Mindset

Marketing at Hyprnote is not about hype. It's about being genuinely helpful and building trust through transparency. Every piece of content should educate, inspire, or solve a problem. If it doesn't, we don't publish it.

## Principles

**Build in public** — Share the journey openly. Wins, challenges, lessons. Our open-source identity means transparency is the default.

**Own the channels** — Website, blog, docs, social presence. Core messaging lives on platforms we control. Third-party platforms amplify, they don't define.

**Consistency** — Tweet, blog post, or support email — the voice is unmistakably Hyprnote. Clear, helpful, human.

**GitHub-based workflow** — Content lives as MDX files in Git. Marketing planning lives in [fastrepl/marketing](https://github.com/fastrepl/marketing). Same tools as code, same review process.

## Cross-Functional

Marketers at Hyprnote should understand the product deeply. Use Hyprnote daily. Know what makes it different. The best content comes from people who genuinely believe in what they're writing about.
