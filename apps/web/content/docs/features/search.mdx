At Hyprnote, we believe that a seamless search experience is an essential part of a note-taking app. The more you use the app,
the more information accumulates. Therefore, there should be a way for you to conveniently search through numerous files and
get access to this information. Moreover, the app should be able to retrieve relevant previous notes and information and provide them to you whenever you need them,
in the right context.

## Search/Command Palette

Currently, all information searching happens through the Search/Command Palette, which you can open by pressing the `cmd + k` shortcut or
clicking the global search bar at the top of the application.

When the palette opens, simply type in any keyword you want to search for.

At its most basic level, you can search for notes by their title or content.

There's also a filter feature where you can sort notes based on certain criteria (newest, oldest).

Furthermore, you can type in a person's name to see their contact information and meetings they participated in.

If you click the person's contact, you will be redirected to that person's contact information within the [Finder View](/features/finder).

## What's next?

- Develop a more comprehensive way for users to organize information and notes through the tag system
- Allow search through tagging and events
