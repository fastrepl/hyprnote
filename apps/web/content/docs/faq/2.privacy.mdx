## Where is my data stored?

All your recordings, transcripts, and notes are stored locally on your device in plain files (SQLite database, JSON, and Markdown). By default, nothing leaves your machine.

If you enable cloud features (cloud transcription or cloud LLM), the relevant data (audio for transcription, text for AI processing) is sent to the provider you selected. See [AI Models & Data Privacy](/docs/faq/ai-models-and-privacy) for the full list of what gets sent and to whom.

## Is my data encrypted?

Char stores data as plain files on disk and does not add its own encryption layer. Your data is protected by your operating system's file permissions and any full-disk encryption you have enabled (such as FileVault on macOS or LUKS on Linux). We recommend enabling full-disk encryption for maximum protection.

## What analytics does Char collect?

Char collects anonymous usage analytics (event names, app version, device fingerprint) via PostHog and Outlit. No meeting content, audio, or transcripts are included in analytics. You can disable analytics entirely in Settings.

Char also uses Sentry for crash reporting in release builds, which sends error messages and stack traces.

## Can my employer see my Char recordings?

No. Char stores everything locally on your device. Unless you explicitly share your notes or recordings, they remain private to you.
