Pro includes access to premium cloud transcription services that offer higher accuracy than local models, especially for accented speech, technical jargon, and noisy environments.

## Supported Providers

Pro users can choose from multiple cloud transcription providers, each with different strengths:

| Provider | Best For | Languages |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Deepgram | Real-time accuracy, keyword handling | 30+ |
| AssemblyAI | Speaker diarization, streaming | 20+ |
| Gladia | Code switching, multi-channel audio | 90+ |
| OpenAI | Batch transcription, Whisper API | 50+ |
| Soniox | High accuracy, enterprise features | 70+ |

## How to Enable

1. Activate your Pro license or start a free trial
2. Go to Settings > Transcription
3. Select your preferred cloud provider

The Pro cloud endpoint handles API keys automatically, so no additional configuration is needed. During onboarding, Pro trial users get automatic model and provider selection for the best out-of-box experience.

## Language Support

Hyprnote now checks if your selected provider supports your configured languages. If there's a mismatch, you'll see a warning with suggestions for compatible providers. Configure your languages in Settings > Language & Vocabulary.

## When to Use Cloud vs Local

Use cloud transcription when you need maximum accuracy and have internet access. Use local transcription (Whisper models) when privacy is paramount or you're offline. Local models support 50+ languages and run entirely on your device.
