This is written by <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" />, who you'll be directly working with.

## Why are we hiring?

Hyprnote is product-led. Engineering execution is our bottleneck.
We need someone to own responsibility for a certain part of the codebase, and act as first-line reviewer.

- More on this in [who-will-be-a-good-fit](#who-will-be-a-good-fit) section.

2. Feel free to tag <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" /> if you want to discuss something.

You're likely aligned with us if:

- Spend most of time thinking, refactoring, and designing better systems, and leave most of the implementation to AI.
- Love documentation and writing. Happy to do work in an async manner.

You are not likely aligned with us if:

- Obsessed with Claude code hype like Ralph loop
- Optimized for token consumption and code generation.
- Looking for other people to teach you and tell you what to do.

## What to expect?

- Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on.
- You write open source code everyday. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.
- `$100 ~ 150k/year`, `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.
