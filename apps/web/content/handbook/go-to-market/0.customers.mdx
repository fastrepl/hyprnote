People who believe they deserve better than vendor lock-in and subscription treadmills. They want powerful AI tools on their terms.

## Prosumers First

We're focusing on prosumers, especially techy people. If we had to pick one target audience, it would be developers. We're devs ourselves, and every value we hold was centered around the fact that we love dev tools and products that devs love. The more dev-related taste someone has, the more appealing Hyprnote becomes for them.

We're already seeing validation of this approach with users from well-known tech companies joining our community.

## Core Traits

Our customers share these characteristics:

**Autonomy-first** — Choose your own AI models, on-device or cloud. Many already have API credits and wonder why they should pay twice for tools like Otter when they can bring their own key.

**Data-conscious** — Their notes stay theirs, not training data. They understand the value of local-first architecture.

**Tech-forward** — Excited about local AI, want tools that harness it. They appreciate the filesystem as a foundation, not a relic.

**Open source advocates** — Value transparency and extensibility. They're part of the open source community not just for practical reasons, but because it aligns with how they think software should be built.
