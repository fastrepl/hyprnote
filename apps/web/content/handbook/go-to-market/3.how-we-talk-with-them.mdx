Honesty and clarity. No marketing fluff, no overpromising. What we do well, where we're still improving.

- **Be direct** — Say what we mean
- **Be helpful** — Solve problems, don't sell features
- **Be responsive** — Every piece of feedback is valuable
- **Be transparent** — Share our roadmap, acknowledge limitations
