## What is Source Analysis?

During long meetings, it's easy to lose track of specific details and conversations.

When reviewing your AI-generated meeting summary, you might wonder "Did someone actually say this? I don't remember this being discussed."

You may want to verify the accuracy of the AI's work or dive deeper into the actual conversation that took place.

This is where our Source Analysis feature becomes invaluable. In your enhanced meeting notes, simply hover over any text you want to examine and click the 'Source' button.

A small box will appear below the text, displaying the exact quote from the transcript where that detail was mentioned, along with an explanation of why the AI found that quote relevant.
