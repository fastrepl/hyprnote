summary: "How we use GitHub to plan and track marketing content across all channels."

We use GitHub Projects and Issues to plan marketing content. Same tools we use for code, now for content. Transparent, version-controlled, and open.

## Why GitHub for Marketing

Our marketing planning lives in [fastrepl/marketing](https://github.com/fastrepl/marketing). Using GitHub keeps everything in one place and aligns with our values of openness and transparency.

- **Single source of truth** — All content ideas, drafts, and feedback in one place
- **Collaboration** — Comment threads, reviews, and assignments work the same as code
- **Visibility** — Anyone on the team can see what's planned and in progress
- **History** — Every decision and iteration is tracked

## Content Types

We track different content types using a custom field in GitHub Projects:

- **YouTube** — Video content, tutorials, product demos
- **Blog** — Long-form articles, technical deep-dives
- **LinkedIn** — Professional updates, company news
- **Twitter/X** — Quick updates, engagement posts
- **Other** — Podcasts, newsletters, partnerships

## Workflow

Each piece of content starts as a GitHub Issue. The issue moves through project board columns as it progresses:

1. **Idea** — Initial concept, rough outline
2. **In Progress** — Being created or recorded
3. **Review** — Ready for feedback from team
4. **Published** — Live and distributed

## Feedback and Iteration

Use issue comments for feedback. Tag specific team members for review. Link related issues when content builds on previous work.

This approach means marketing becomes as iterative and collaborative as our product development.
