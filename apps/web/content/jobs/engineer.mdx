This is written by <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" name="Yujong" />, who you'll be directly working with.

## Why are we hiring?

Char is product-led. Engineering execution is our bottleneck.
We need someone to own responsibility for a certain part of the codebase and act as a first-line reviewer.

## What are we expecting?

We need someone who:

- Can take full responsibility for a certain part of the codebase.
- Can define a problem & a solution without relying on others.

## How to apply?

1. Read the code and browse existing issues in the [repository](https://github.com/fastrepl/char). (Hint: [Bounties](/bounties))
2. Feel free to tag <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" name="Yujong" /> if you want to discuss something.
3. Propose a problem/solution through an issue, comment, or pull request.
4. [Send us an email](mailto:founders@char.com) that references step 3. We are not really looking for a resume. Something like GH account where I can see your past work and interests would be enough.

## Who will be a good fit?

We are not judging anything, but we just want to find the best fit for the role.

You're likely aligned with us if:

- You spend most of your time thinking, refactoring, and designing better systems, and leave most of the implementation to AI.
- You love documentation and writing. You are happy to do work in an async manner.

You are not likely aligned with us if:

- You are obsessed with Claude code hype like Ralph loop
- You are optimized for token consumption and code generation.
- You are looking for other people to teach you and tell you what to do.

## What to expect?

- Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <CharIcon /> Char on.
- You write open source code every day. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.
- `$80 ~ 150k/year`, `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.
