The settings file is located at:

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/settings.json
```

You can edit this file directly, but changes only take effect after restarting Char. For most settings, use the in-app Settings panel instead.

## Timezone

Char detects your system timezone automatically. If you need to override it (e.g., you travel frequently or your system clock is wrong), go to **Settings** > **General** and select a timezone from the searchable dropdown. The chosen timezone controls how session timestamps appear in the sidebar timeline.

## Week Start Day

Under **Settings** > **General**, the **Week starts on** option lets you choose the first day of the week in the calendar view. You can pick **System** (follows your locale), **Sunday**, or **Monday**.

## In-Meeting Reminder (Lab)

Under **Settings** > **Lab**, you can enable the **In-Meeting Reminder** toggle. When enabled, Char detects when apps like Zoom or Google Meet have been using your microphone for several minutes without Char recording, and sends a notification reminding you to start capturing the meeting.
