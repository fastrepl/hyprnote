## Downloading Staging Builds

Staging builds are created when testing new features before they go to nightly or stable releases. The easiest way to download the latest staging build is using the dedicated workflow:

1. Go to the [Download Latest Staging Build workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/download_staging.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the platform (currently `macos-aarch64` for Apple Silicon Macs)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Once complete, download the artifact from the workflow run

Staging builds are stored in R2 with filenames like `hyprnote-staging-{timestamp}-{commit}-macos-aarch64.dmg`, making it easy to identify which commit a build corresponds to.

You can also download directly from the desktop_cd workflow artifacts:

1. Go to the [desktop_cd workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Find the staging build run you want
3. Download `hyprnote-staging-macos-silicon` from the Artifacts section

## Triggering Staging Builds

To trigger a staging build for a PR or branch:

1. Comment `/staging` on the PR
2. The bot will trigger a staging build and reply with a link to the workflow run
3. Once complete, use the download workflow or artifacts to get the build

You can also trigger a staging build manually:

1. Go to [desktop_cd.yaml workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch and choose "staging" as the channel
4. Click "Run workflow"
