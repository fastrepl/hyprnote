## You won't get along with us

- If you only want to design in Figma
- If you prefer mockups over shipping
- If you skip quality to move fast
- If you need process to make progress
- If you don't want to do marketing
- If you want a short-term role

## Why we need your help

Hyprnote is product-led. Design execution is our bottleneck - visual quality depends too much on the founder. **We need someone to own design across product and marketing.**

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

<Collapsible title="Curious about how we're doing?">
7.4k GitHub stars, 9.2% conversion rate, 50k app downloads, 30% WoW DAU growth, 38% week-5 retention, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />
</Collapsible>

## What you'll be doing

Own visual quality across product, website, and marketing. Design and ship real UI. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used.

Success: the product feels calmer + more solid, marketing doesn't wait on the founder, design decisions feel obvious.

## Who we want to meet

A designer who codes and ships. Fast, independent, uncompromising on quality. Interested in marketing and storytelling. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## How we work

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack, occasional calls. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.

You must be comfortable with <ToolIcon icon="logos:figma" /> Figma, basic video editing, and a huge plus if you can code.

You will work directly with <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> and <GitHubMention username="harshikaalagh-netizen" name="Harshika" />.

## How we compensate

Ballpark: $80–120k/year, 0.5–1.5% equity. Depends on scope and experience.

Early, high-ownership role. You'll grow with the company.
