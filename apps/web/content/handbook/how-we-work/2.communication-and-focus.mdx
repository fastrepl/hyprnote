summary: "GitHub is the source of truth, Slack is for coordination, phone is for emergencies."

Balance independence with sync. Too much disturbance kills focus; too little causes drift.

## Tools

**GitHub Issues and Projects** — Single source of truth for decisions, tasks, and prioritization. [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6) is where work gets tracked. Customer feedback flows here too — Discussions for feature conversations, Issues for bugs, Projects for prioritization.

**Slack** — Lightweight coordination. Long updates belong in GitHub. Huddles for real-time discussion when async isn't cutting it.

**Devin** — AI software engineer with a dedicated Slack channel. Treated like a colleague with transparent workflow.

**Dev tools** — Zed, GitButler, Cursor, Claude Code.

## Escalation

- **Phone** — Truly urgent, can't wait
- **Slack mention** — Reasonably urgent, can wait hours
- **GitHub** — Everything else, async

## AI-Augmented

A small, mission-aligned team augmented with AI can outperform companies with hundreds of people. We use AI teammates (Devin, Claude Code) for routine engineering work, content generation, and codebase maintenance. See [Automated Workflows](/company-handbook/how-we-work/automated-workflows/) for specifics.
