## Yet Another Note-Taking App?

Hyprnote is more than a notepad — it is so damn simple to use that it feels like magic. You can take notes during meetings, have it listen to them, and even summarize the content for you. But this is just the beginning.

## How Work Should Be

Hyprnote will become the gateway to a new way of working. It will remember everything that's said, derive insights, help you think, and **act on your behalf**. It will be your trusted companion in the world of work.

## We'd Love to Hear From You

If you are interested in what we're building and just want to talk to us, you can [hop on a quick 20-min call](https:/hyprnote.com/founders) with us.

Now, let's get to work!

Cheers,

Team Hyprnote
