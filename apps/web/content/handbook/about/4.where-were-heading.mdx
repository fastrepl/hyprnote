**A suite of open-source, AI-native tools** that empower individuals and organizations without locking them into opaque platforms.

**A fortress-grade enterprise solution** that serves compliance-sensitive industries while remaining simple enough for everyday use.

## Our Ambition

Our ambition is simple: build the AI-native productivity stack that feels as natural and indispensable as having a world-class assistant by your side.
