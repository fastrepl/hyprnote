## Day 1: Get Set Up

### Accounts and Access

When you join, you'll get access to:

- **GitHub** — Added to the [fastrepl](https://github.com/fastrepl) org. This is where all code, issues, projects, and content live.
- **Slack** — Our lightweight coordination tool. Introduce yourself, ask questions, don't be shy.
- **Infisical** — Ask a team member for an invite. We use [Infisical](https://infisical.com) to manage environment variables and secrets for development.
- **Hyprnote admin** — Sign in at `https://hyprnote.com/admin` with your authorized email for content management.

### Dev Environment

We recommend [Cursor](https://cursor.com) if you don't have a specific IDE preference. Other tools we use: Zed, GitButler, Claude Code.

### Developer Documentation

We have dedicated [developer documentation](/docs/developers/setup) covering setup, environment variables, running the app, login/auth, and more. Read through it early — it answers most setup questions.

### Day 1 Checklist

- [ ] GitHub org access confirmed
- [ ] Slack joined, introduced yourself
- [ ] Infisical access confirmed
- [ ] Read the [developer documentation](/docs/developers/setup)
- [ ] Dev environment set up (IDE installed, repo cloned, builds locally)
- [ ] Read this handbook — seriously, all of it
- [ ] Downloaded a [staging build](/handbook/onboarding/staging-builds) and opened Hyprnote

## Days 2-3: Get Familiar

- [ ] Use Hyprnote in your own meetings
- [ ] Browse [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6) to understand current priorities
- [ ] Read through recent PRs to understand what's being worked on
- [ ] Make a test PR (fix a typo, improve a doc, anything)

## Week 1: Ship Something

This is the most important part. **Ship something real in your first week.** A bug fix, a small feature, a piece of content, a design improvement — it doesn't matter what, as long as it's real and merged.

- [ ] Pick a task from GitHub Projects or find something that bugs you
- [ ] Ship it via PR
- [ ] Get it reviewed and merged

Shipping fast builds momentum and helps you understand the codebase, the review process, and the team. Don't wait until you feel "ready" — you learn by doing.

## Week 2: Own Something

- [ ] Take ownership of a task from the current sprint
- [ ] Attend (or listen to recording of) the next planning sync
- [ ] Start forming opinions about what should be better

## Questions?

Ask in Slack. There are no dumb questions, especially in your first two weeks. If the answer isn't documented, that's a bug — fix it by adding it to the handbook via PR.
