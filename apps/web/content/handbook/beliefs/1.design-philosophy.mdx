**Specialization Within Integration** — Don't try to be everything. Best at meeting notes, integrated with your broader system. No walled garden. One thing, done exceptionally well.

**Simplicity Creates Coherence** — Startups win through clearer philosophy, not feature accumulation. Remove features more often than add them. Minimum complexity for the current task.

**Multiple Interfaces, Unified Data** — Different thinking modes deserve different environments. Specialized interfaces on unified data. Separation without fragmentation.

**Friction-Free Publishing** — Writing and publishing merge into one action. Reduced friction removes barriers to documentation.

**Substrate Over Abstraction** — Filesystem remains foundational as intelligence layers expand. Build on lasting infrastructure. AI evolves, your data remains.
