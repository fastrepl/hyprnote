This guide covers workflows and resources specific to designteers working on Hyprnote.

## Downloading Staging Builds

Staging builds are created when testing new features before they go to nightly or stable releases. To download a staging build:

1. Go to the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Find the workflow run for the staging build you want (look for runs with "staging" channel)
3. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
4. Download `hyprnote-staging-macos-silicon` for Apple Silicon Macs

Alternatively, staging builds are automatically uploaded to R2 storage after successful builds. The latest staging build can be accessed at:

```
s3://hyprnote-build/desktop/staging/hyprnote-macos-aarch64.dmg
```

Note: You'll need appropriate R2 credentials to access the S3 bucket directly. For most testing purposes, downloading from GitHub Actions artifacts is the recommended approach.

## Triggering Staging Builds

To trigger a staging build for a PR or branch:

1. Comment `/staging` on the PR
2. The bot will trigger a staging build and reply with a link to the workflow run
3. Once complete, download the artifact from the workflow run

You can also trigger a staging build manually:

1. Go to [desktop_cd.yaml workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch and choose "staging" as the channel
4. Click "Run workflow"
