summary: "Be genuinely helpful, build in public, and make the voice unmistakably Char everywhere."

Every piece of content, every interaction shapes how people think about us. We take this seriously.

## North Star

Be genuinely helpful. Every piece of content should educate, inspire, or solve a problem. If it doesn't, we don't publish it.

## Principles

**Own the Channel** — We control our narrative through our website, blog, docs, and social presence. Core messaging lives on platforms we own.

**Consistency** — Tweet, blog post, or support email — the voice is unmistakably Char. Clear, helpful, human.

**Frictionless Publishing** — Systems that make it easy to publish. No bureaucracy. Write in your IDE, submit a PR, done. See [CMS](/company-handbook/how-we-work/cms/) for how this works in practice.

**Build in Public** — Share the journey openly. Wins, challenges, lessons. Transparency builds trust and invites community participation. Since we're open source, default to sharing — the bar for keeping something private should be high (see [AGENTS.md guidelines](/company-handbook/) for what stays private).
