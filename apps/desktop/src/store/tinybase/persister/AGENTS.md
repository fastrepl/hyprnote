- Persisters define both load/save. The call site decides what to use (e.g., startAutoSave vs startAutoLoad).
- `local.ts` and `settings.ts` do both save/load.
- `folder.ts` is used as load-only (syncs filesystem → store for folders and session folder_id).
- `session/` is the unified persister for session-related data (sessions, transcripts, notes, etc.). It combines load from multiple sources in a single scan and uses separate collectors for save.
- Other persisters are used as save-only for now.
