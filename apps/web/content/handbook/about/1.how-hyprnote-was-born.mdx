Hyprnote was born from frustration.

**John's sales background** meant living through countless meetings where existing tools transcribed but didn't go further.

**Yujong's open-source background** brought the conviction that solutions must be transparent and community-driven. Create massive value first, capture some of it later.

**Together with Duck**, we wanted craft and simplicity. Trustworthy, reliable, uncompromising.
