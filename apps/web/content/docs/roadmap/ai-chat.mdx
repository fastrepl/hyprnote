## What we currently have (Pro Plan)

ou can activate the chat panel by clicking the chat button next to the transcript toggle button. Currently, each chat is confined to the specific meeting from which it was activated.

We believe the biggest role of chat in a meeting notetaker is to help users rewrite summaries in the style and structure they prefer. For example, in the image above, we’re asking the chat to rewrite the summary of Steve Jobs' speech using more direct quotes pulled from the transcript.

If you like the suggestion, you can apply it directly by clicking the **‘Apply’** button in the markdown block. Chat is instructed to output note-structured content inside markdown blocks when appropriate.

You can also easily add more context to your requests by mentioning other meeting notes or people stored in your contacts. For example, you can ask:

- “Summarize my past conversations with @Steve,” or
- “What changes have been made in this meeting compared to @July-1st-all-hands?”

Currently, HyprLLM isn't fully optimized for chat responses, so we recommend using custom endpoints (e.g., OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-latest`) for the best experience.

## What we will be building (soon)

We understand that meetings are a core part of everyday business activities. All the follow-up work, such as sending emails, updating your company knowledge base, and sharing documents with colleagues, is closely connected to those meetings. With chat, we want to help you manage these workflows as smoothly as possible.

Here are the upcoming features we're planning to add:

- **Tool-Calling**: Perform powerful actions like automatically sending information to your email, CRM, and more.
- **MCP Connection**: Integrate with your external MCPs such as Notion, email, and research tools.
- **Global Chat**: A seamless chat experience shouldn't be limited to a single meeting or note. Like AI code editors (for example, Cursor), our global chat will understand your intent and pull in the right context, including past meeting notes and participant information, wherever you are.
