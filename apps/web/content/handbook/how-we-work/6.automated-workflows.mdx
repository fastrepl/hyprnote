We use GitHub Actions cron jobs to automate recurring tasks. These workflows run on a schedule and use Devin AI to handle the work.

## Weekly Blog Post

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 12:00 UTC

**What it does:** Analyzes git commits and changelogs from the past 7 days, then writes a "Hyprnote Weekly" blog post summarizing what shipped. The post is created as a PR for review before publishing.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_weekly_blog.yaml`

## Daily Documentation Update

**Schedule:** Every day at 00:00 UTC

**What it does:** Reviews recent code changes and updates technical documentation to keep it in sync with the codebase. Checks for new features, API changes, environment variables, and other developer-facing updates.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_update_docs.yaml`

## Daily Clippy Fixes

**Schedule:** Every day at 00:00 UTC

**What it does:** Runs `cargo clippy --fix` to automatically apply Rust linting suggestions, then creates a PR with the fixes.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_cargo_clippy.yaml`

## Monthly Legal Review

**Schedule:** First day of every month at 00:00 UTC

**What it does:** Reviews product changes from the past 30 days and flags any that might have legal implications (data collection, third-party integrations, privacy changes). Creates a report for human review without automatically modifying legal documents.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_review_legal.yaml`

## Manual Triggers

All workflows can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions tab using `workflow_dispatch`. This is useful for testing or running outside the normal schedule.
