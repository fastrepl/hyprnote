Balance independence with sync. Too much disturbance kills focus; too little causes drift.

## Tools

**GitHub Issues and Projects** — Single source of truth. Decisions, tasks, prioritization in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6). Transparent, no digging through chat.

**Slack** — Lightweight coordination. Long updates belong in GitHub. Huddles for real-time discussion.

**Devin** — AI software engineer with dedicated Slack channel. Treated like a colleague, transparent workflow.

**GitHub as CMS** — IDEs double as blog editors. Write something? Submit a PR.

**Dev tools** — Zed, GitButler, Cursor, Claude Code.

## Escalation

- **Phone** — Truly urgent, can't wait
- **Slack mention** — Reasonably urgent, can wait hours
- **GitHub** — Everything else, async

## AI-Augmented

Small, mission-aligned team augmented with AI can outperform companies with hundreds of people.
