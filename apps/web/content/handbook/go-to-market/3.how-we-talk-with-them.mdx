We communicate with honesty and clarity. No marketing fluff, no overpromising. We tell people what Hyprnote does well and where we're still improving.

## Communication Principles

**Be direct** — Say what we mean, mean what we say.

**Be helpful** — Focus on solving problems, not selling features.

**Be responsive** — Treat every piece of feedback as valuable.

**Be transparent** — Share our roadmap, acknowledge our limitations.
