title: "Why Local-First?"

## Local-first \> Cloud-first

Excel is far better than Google Sheets because it's **local-first**. No loading spinners, no sync conflicts, no "reconnecting..." toasts. It just works.

## Your Data, Your Rules

Cloud tools log everything. They store, analyze, and sometimes leak your data. That's fine for public wikis, but not for:

- Client intel
- IP documentation
- Confidential meeting notes
- Anything you wouldn't want indexed

Local-first means your data stays on your machine unless you start syncing. You own the file path. You control the backups.

<Info>
  Hyprnote does collect usage data(=what you clicked) and logs errors by
  default. But you can always opt-out anytime.

## Works Offline == Reliable

Ever tried:

- Loading Notion on hotel Wi-Fi?
- Opening Google Sheets on a train?
- Working on a plane without paying \$30 for garbage internet?

Local tools don't care about your connection status. They just work.

## The Best of Both Worlds

Want collaboration without sacrificing privacy? Use proxy servers or self-hosted sync. You get local-first benefits \+ team features when you need them.
