Own your work. Move fast. Communicate openly. We don't micromanage — we trust you to figure things out. In return: autonomy, impact, and the chance to build something meaningful.

## Open Positions

We're hiring for roles where you'll have real ownership and impact from day one.

**[Engineer](/jobs/engineer)** — Take full responsibility for a part of the codebase. Define problems and solutions independently. Build with Tauri, Rust, and TypeScript. We need someone who spends most of their time thinking, refactoring, and designing better systems — leaving implementation to AI. Compensation: `$80 ~ 150k/year` + `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity.

**[Designteer](/jobs/designteer)** — Own visual quality across product and marketing. Design and ship real UI, not just mockups. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used. We need a designer who codes, ships fast, and cares about craft. Compensation: `$80 ~ 120k/year` + `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity.

## How We Work Together

Remote-first. Async via Slack. Occasional calls with Hyprnote on. Everything runs through GitHub — bug reports, feature requests, code review, and project management. Small team, high trust, craft over hype.
