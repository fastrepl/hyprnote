At Hyprnote, our way of working is designed to maximize focus, creativity, and speed. As a software company, we have the flexibility to work from anywhere and embrace that each founder has a different style.

We meet in person monthly for planning sessions, but otherwise work remotely from wherever suits us best.

## Individual Styles

**John** is nocturnal and moves from place to place throughout the day — coffee shops, parks, different environments. Wakes up around 9 AM, does cardio in the morning, works throughout the day, and lifts weights at night. Attempts to live an organized life while embracing flexibility.

**Yujong** is the opposite — disciplined and anti-nocturnal. Wakes up very early, sleeps very early, and thrives in calm, ordered environments where he can achieve deep focus and think through systems at the root level.

## Our Culture

Our culture acknowledges these differences. Productivity comes not from forcing uniformity, but from creating conditions where each person can deliver their best.
