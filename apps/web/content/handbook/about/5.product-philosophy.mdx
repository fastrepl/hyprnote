## AI Notetaking vs AI Assistant

Char has two capabilities that work together but serve different purposes:

**AI Notetaking** — A notepad that uses AI to improve the notetaking experience in meetings. Real-time transcription during meetings, intelligent summaries when meetings end. We say "notetaking" not "notetaker" because you're actively engaged — not passively letting a bot do it for you.

**AI Assistant** — Goes beyond the meeting. While notetaking reacts to what happens in the meeting, the assistant is proactive. It gathers context from outside the meeting, executes follow-up tasks, and helps you act on what you learned.

The notetaking is the foundation. The assistant is the superpower.

## Human-First

AI should reduce cognitive load, not replace judgment. You remain central. The AI works for you, not the other way around. Always see what's happening, always override.

We build for people with high agency — those who want control over their tools, their data, and their workflows. You choose the AI. You own the data. You decide the workflow. We're not building a system you work inside. We're building a tool that works for you.
