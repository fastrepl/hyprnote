Hyprnote was born from real frustration.

## The Founders' Perspectives

**John's background in sales** meant living through countless meetings where tools like ClovaNote or Granola weren't enough — they transcribed, but didn't go further.

**Yujong's deep open-source background** brought the conviction that the best solutions must be transparent, extensible, and community-driven. The world is built on open source, and we believe the best way forward is to create massive value first, then capture some of it.

**Together with Duck**, we wanted a product that reflected our shared obsession with craft and simplicity. Hyprnote had to feel trustworthy, reliable, and uncompromising in quality.

## Perfect Timing

The rise of LLMs made this timing perfect: ideas can be prototyped faster, models run locally, and hardware performance keeps getting stronger. What once felt impossible (AI assistants running fully on-device) is now real.
