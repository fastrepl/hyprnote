The settings file is located at:

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/settings.json
```

You can edit this file directly, but changes only take effect after restarting Hyprnote. For most settings, use the in-app Settings panel instead.

## Timezone

Hyprnote detects your system timezone automatically. If you need to override it (e.g., you travel frequently or your system clock is wrong), go to **Settings** > **General** and select a timezone from the searchable dropdown. The chosen timezone controls how session timestamps appear in the sidebar timeline.
