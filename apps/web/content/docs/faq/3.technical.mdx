## What are the system requirements?

Hyprnote requires macOS 12.0 or later with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel processor. We recommend at least 8GB of RAM for optimal performance with local AI features.

## How much storage space does Hyprnote need?

The app itself is about 200MB. Recording storage depends on your usage - a 1-hour meeting uses approximately 50-100MB. We recommend having at least 5GB of free space.

## Does Hyprnote work offline?

Yes! Since Hyprnote uses local AI, it works completely offline. You don't need an internet connection to record, transcribe, or generate summaries.
