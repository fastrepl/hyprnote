summary: "Everyone deserves bespoke software with full control over their AI and data."

Most AI tools force you into their ecosystem, their models, their rules. Locked into subscriptions, dependent on cloud services, no real control. Hyprnote proves another path exists.

## What Makes Us Different

- **Model flexibility** — On-device, cloud, or mix and match
- **Data ownership** — Local-first, privacy-first
- **Open source** — Transparent, extensible, community-driven
- **Future-proof** — Built for the shift to local AI

You shouldn't need enterprise budgets to have powerful, flexible AI tools that respect your autonomy.

## The Filesystem Is the Cortex

We believe your notes should live as files, not database rows. File-based systems aren't a relic — they're a cognitive model that mirrors how humans naturally organize information. When notes live as files, they feel like part of you. When they live as opaque blobs behind an API, they feel like someone else's product.

Hyprnote is file-based and local-first, so it doesn't have to live in isolation. It can sit alongside your existing vault, read from your knowledge base, and write back into it. We're not building another walled garden — we're building a tool that fits into the cortex.
