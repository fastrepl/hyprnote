summary: "GitHub Issues is our main public channel for feedback, keeping us open-source friendly and transparent."

Early on, we had too many feedback channels — email, Intercom, Canny, Discord, GitHub, Linear. We've since streamlined. Today, GitHub is our main public channel, with everything else synced into it. This helps us stay open-source friendly, transparent, and focused.

## The Principle

The principle is simple: one source of truth, open to everyone.

## Our Channels

**GitHub** is our primary platform for user engagement:
- **GitHub Discussions** for feedback requests and feature conversations
- **GitHub Issues** for bug reports and tracked work

We do have other channels like Zendesk and Discord, and hope to streamline this further in the future with AI assistance.

**content-collections** (technically GitHub) powers our:
- Roadmaps
- Blog posts
- Documentation

This approach keeps everything in one ecosystem, making it easier for both our team and the community to stay aligned.
