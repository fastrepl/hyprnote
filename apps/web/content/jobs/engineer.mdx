(WIP) 

This is written by <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" />, who you'll be directly working with.

## Why are we hiring?

Hyprnote is product-led. Engineering execution is our bottleneck - code quality depends too much on the founder. We need someone to own quality across the stack and act as first-line reviewer.

<details>
<summary>And we're doing pretty well these days</summary>

38% week-5 retention, 30% WoW DAU growth, 9.2% web conversion, 7.4k GitHub stars, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />
</details>

## What are we expecting?

We need someone who:

- Can take full responsibility of certain part of the codebase.
- Can define problem & solution without relying on others.
- More on this in [who-will-be-a-good-fit](#who-will-be-a-good-fit) section.

## How to apply?

1. Read the code, and browse existing issues in [Hyprnote](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote) repository.
2. Feel free to tag <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" /> if you want to discuss something.
3. Propose a problem/solution through an issue, comment, or pull request.
4. [Send us an email](mailto:founders@hyprnote.com) which points to the `3`. Do not include resume or anything similar.

## Who will be a good fit?

We are not judging anything, but we are just want to find the best fit for the role.

### AI Coding

- Generating code part is solved.
- If all you do is prompting AI to generated code, I dont need you. I can do better prompting because I already know the codebase and the problem. We have infinite number of devin to spawn.
- If you are into spwaning bunch of Claude Code and generating bunch of codes with some hot Agentic coding tech like Raulph loop, I dont wanna work with you.
- Instead, if you are using spending bunch of tokens for codebase understanding, debugging, brainstorming, we are here to support you with whatever tokens you need.
- Who spend time on "Can we do this simpler?" "Can you refactor this to be ~?"

### Testing & Quality Assurance

-  I am not interested in spending resources on manual
</details>

## What to expect?

- Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on.
- You write open source code everyday. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.
- `$100 ~ 150k/year`, `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.
