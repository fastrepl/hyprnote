This is written by <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" name="Yujong" />, who you'll be directly working with.

## Why are we hiring?

Hyprnote is product-led. Engineering execution is our bottleneck.
We need someone to own responsibility for a certain part of the codebase and act as a first-line reviewer.

<Collapsible title="And we're doing pretty well these days">
7.4k GitHub stars, 9.2% conversion rate, 50k app downloads, 30% WoW DAU growth, 38% week-5 retention, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />
</Collapsible>

## What are we expecting?

We need someone who:

- Can take full responsibility for a certain part of the codebase.
- Can define problem & solution without relying on others.

## How to apply?

1. Read the code and browse existing issues in the [Hyprnote](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote) repository.
2. Feel free to tag <GitHubMention username="yujonglee" name="Yujong" /> if you want to discuss something.
3. Propose a problem/solution through an issue, comment, or pull request.
4. [Send us an email](mailto:founders@hyprnote.com) which points to the `3`. Do not include resume or anything similar.

## Who will be a good fit?

We are not judging anything, but we just want to find the best fit for the role.

You're likely aligned with us if:

- Spend most of your time thinking, refactoring, and designing better systems, and leave most of the implementation to AI.
- Love documentation and writing. Happy to do work in an async manner.

<br/>

You are not likely aligned with us if:

- Obsessed with Claude code hype like Ralph loop
- Optimized for token consumption and code generation.
- Looking for other people to teach you and tell you what to do.

## What to expect?

- Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on.
- You write open source code every day. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.
- `$100 ~ 150k/year`, `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.
