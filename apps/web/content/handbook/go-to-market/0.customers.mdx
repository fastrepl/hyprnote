Our customers are people who believe they deserve better than vendor lock-in and subscription treadmills. They want powerful AI tools that work on their terms, not someone else's.

## Who We Build For

**People who value autonomy** — They want to choose their own AI models, whether on-device for privacy or cloud for power.

**Data-conscious individuals** — They believe their conversations and notes should stay theirs, not fed into someone else's training data.

**Tech-forward professionals** — They're excited about the potential of local AI and want tools that harness this shift, not fight it.

**Open source advocates** — They appreciate transparency, extensibility, and community-driven development.
