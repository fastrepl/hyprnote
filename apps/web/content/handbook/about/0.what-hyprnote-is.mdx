Hyprnote is an open-source AI notetaker built for people who believe they deserve bespoke software and complete control over their AI. At its core, Hyprnote is more than just a notetaker — it's the beginning of an AI-native executive assistant that works exactly the way you want it to.

## Reducing Cognitive Load

Note-taking reduces cognitive load. We're extending that idea: what other cognitive burdens can we offload to software? Our vision is for Hyprnote to take care of your notes today, and in the future, your email, calendar, and broader workflow — giving you the experience of having someone trustworthy "taking care of things" on your behalf.

## Your AI, Your Way

Hyprnote gives you full flexibility and control:

- Use on-device AI models for complete privacy
- Bring any AI model you prefer — cloud or local
- Own your data completely
- Harness the power of AI without vendor lock-in

Simple, accessible, and platform-agnostic. Like Apple Notes, but built for meetings. Like an assistant that not only records but also understands and organizes what matters — and does it your way.
