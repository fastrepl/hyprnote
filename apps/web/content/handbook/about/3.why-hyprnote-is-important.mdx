In a world where work is increasingly digital and fragmented, individuals and companies need tools they can trust. Most note-taking and assistant products are cloud-first, with trade-offs in privacy and control. Hyprnote proves another path is possible:

## Our Differentiators

**Local-first, privacy-first.** Your data stays yours.

**Enterprise-grade, open-source.** Compliance-ready, extensible, and transparent.

**Future-proof.** Hardware is advancing rapidly, and local AI is becoming the norm. Hyprnote is built to harness this shift.

## Our Belief

We believe every company and individual deserves software that works for them, not against them.
