## What is Hyprnote?

Hyprnote is an AI notetaking app specifically designed to take meeting notes. With Hyprnote, you can transcribe all kinds of meetings whether it be online or offline.

- **Listens** to your meetings so you can only jot down important stuff
- No bots joining your meetings - Hyprnote listens directly to sounds coming in & out of your computer
- Crafts perfect **summaries** based on your memos, right after the meeting is over
- You can run Hyprnote completely **offline** by using LM Studio or Ollama

You can also use it for taking notes for lectures or organizing your thoughts

### Bring Your Own LLM
Prefer something custom? You can swap in your own language model:

- Run local models via Ollama
- Use approved third-party APIs like Gemini, Claude, or Azure-hosted GPT
- Stay compliant with whatever your org allows

Hyprnote plays nice with whatever stack you’re running.

### Note Templates
Prefer a certain style? Choose from predefined templates like bullet points, agenda-based, or paragraph summary. Or create your own.
