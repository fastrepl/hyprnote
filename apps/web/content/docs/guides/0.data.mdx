Hyprnote stores all data locally using JSON and Markdown files. Nothing leaves your device unless you explicitly use cloud features.

## Data Location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/hyprnote/` |

In development mode, the folder name changes to `com.hyprnote.dev` or `com.hyprnote.staging`.

## Directory Structure

```
hyprnote/
├── settings.json    # App configuration
├── sessions/        # Session data and audio recordings
│   └── {session_id}/
│       ├── _meta.json       # Session metadata
│       ├── transcript.json  # Transcript data
│       ├── _memo.md         # Your notes
│       └── _summary.md      # AI-generated summary
└── models/          # Downloaded AI models
    ├── llm/         # LLM models (.gguf)
    └── stt/         # STT models (.gguf)
```

## Export

Select any note and use the export menu to save as PDF, Markdown, JSON, or VTT (with speaker information).

## Backup

Copy the entire data directory to back up your notes. Include this folder in your regular backup routine. Since data is stored as human-readable JSON and Markdown files, you can also version control your notes with Git.
