## Local-First Storage

Hyprnote stores all your data locally on your device. Your notes, transcriptions, and summaries are saved in a SQLite database within the app's data directory.

## Data Location

Your data is stored in the following locations:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.hyprnote.desktop`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/com.hyprnote.desktop`

## Export

You can export your notes in various formats directly from the app. Select any note and use the export option to save it as Markdown, JSON, or plain text.

## Backup

Since all data is stored locally, you can back up your notes by copying the entire data directory. We recommend including this folder in your regular backup routine.

# Base Directory

Hyprnote stores its data in the following directories:

## macOS

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/
```

In `staging` and `dev` mode, the base directory use `com.hyprnote.staging` or `com.hyprnote.dev` instead of `hyprnote`.

# Settings

`<BASE_DIR>/settings.json` is used to store the settings.

# Sessions

`<BASE_DIR>/sessions` is used to store the sessions.
