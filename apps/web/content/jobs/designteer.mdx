This is written by <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" />, whom you'll be directly working with.

<Collapsible title="What's a Designteer?">
Designteer = Designer + Marketer + Engineer; pronounced /dɪˈzɛn.tɪr/

FYI - <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> is an Engigner (= Engineer + Designer + Product Manager; pronounced /ˈɛn.dʒɪ.nər/)

## You won't get along with us

- If you only want to design in Figma
- If you prefer mockups over shipping
- If you skip quality to move fast
- If you need process to make progress
- If you don't want to do marketing
- If you want a short-term role

## Why we need your help

Hyprnote is product-led. Design execution is our bottleneck - visual quality depends too much on the founder. **We need someone to own design across product and marketing.**

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

7.4k GitHub stars, 9.2% conversion rate, 50k app downloads, 30% WoW DAU growth, 38% week-5 retention, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />

## What you'll be doing

Own visual quality across product, website, and marketing. Design and ship real UI. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used.

Success: the product feels calmer + more solid, marketing doesn't wait on the founder, design decisions feel obvious.

## Who we want to meet

A designer who codes and ships. Fast, independent, uncompromising on quality. Interested in marketing and storytelling. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## How we work

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub - [bug reports](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues), [feature requests](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/discussions), [code review](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/pulls), and [project management](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6).

You must be comfortable with <ToolIcon icon="logos:figma" /> Figma, basic video editing, and a huge plus if you can code.

You will work directly with <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> and <GitHubMention username="harshikaalagh-netizen" name="Harshika" />.

## How we compensate

Ballpark: `$80 ~ 120k/year` + `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.

Early, high-ownership role. You'll grow with the company.
