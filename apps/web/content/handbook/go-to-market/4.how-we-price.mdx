We're an open-source, subscription-based SaaS — think Granola AI, but open source. Powerful tools should be accessible. Core product is free and open source. We monetize through Pro subscriptions and enterprise features.

## Pricing Tiers

- **Free for individuals** — Core experience, forever. Most features work without any subscription or licensing.
- **Pro subscription** — Advanced features for power users. Trial starts immediately upon signup to shorten time-to-value.
- **Custom for enterprise** — Tailored for compliance-sensitive organizations. Enterprise focus planned for Q3.

## Why This Model Works

Being open source gives us a distribution advantage — similar to how PostHog and Vercel made their way into the market. Users can try the product with zero friction, and those who find value naturally convert to Pro.
