summary: "The core traits we value most in teammates: Grit, Intellectual honesty, Sharpness, and a Vivid vector."

**Grit** — Building a startup is hard. We need people who push through with resilience and purpose, not blindly, but committed to the mission when progress feels slow.

**Intellectual Honesty** — Say "I don't know" or "I was wrong." Seek truth over being right. Challenge ideas constructively. Update views with better evidence.

**Sharpness** — Think quickly, communicate clearly, execute decisively. Not about being smartest — about being effective under pressure and making good decisions fast.

**A Vivid Vector** — We think of people as a collection of vectors. You don't need to care about everything we care about. But you need a vivid vector that aligns with at least one of our pillars. Artisans with clear direction and genuine passion. Not people with no signal, no taste, no direction.

## What You'll Gain

Become a craftsman. The founders have strong taste. You'll be pushed to develop sharp perspectives and refine your craft alongside a small team that cares deeply.
