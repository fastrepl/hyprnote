The word “Finder” might sound a little vague, but think of it like the Finder in macOS. It’s a viewer that lets you search through your notes, events, and contacts more conveniently.

To open Finder, just click the folder-search icon next to the Settings button on the left-hand toolbar.

## Calendar View

Think of your favorite calendar app—Apple, Google, Notion. Calendar View offers a clean, intuitive layout where you can see your events and their associated notes in one place.

Click on an event to create a note or open an already attached note.

## Table View

If you prefer a more traditional layout, Table View displays all your events and notes in a table format. It’s great for quickly scanning through large amounts of data.

## Contacts View

This view lets you see and manage all your contacts in one place. You can also filter contacts by their organization, making it easier to find who you’re looking for.
