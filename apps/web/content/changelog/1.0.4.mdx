## Note Management

- Undo delete with 5-second countdown timer - accidentally deleted notes can be restored via the "Restore" button or Cmd+Z, with a dissolving animation showing the remaining time
- Space hotkey for controlling audio player playback
- Recently opened notes now appear in a "Recent" section at the top of the Open Note dialog (Cmd+O) for quick access

- AI settings shortcut changed to Cmd+Shift+Comma
- New searchable dropdown component for language and timezone selection

## Calendar

## AI & Transcription

- Auto-enhance now correctly counts words across multiple transcript segments, fixing cases where short segments wouldn't trigger enhancement
