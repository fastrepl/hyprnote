title: "What is Hyprnote?"
description: "Hyprnote is a privacy-first AI notepad for meetings. Think of it as the open-source version of Granola — except that we're cooler."

Hyprnote is awesome because...

- it's [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote)
- it's a [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) app
- you can transcribe and summarize [locally](/about-hyprnote/why-local-first) with no bots
- you can also bring your own models
- you can [host it by yourself](/about-hyprnote/why-self-hosted) — work in progress

## How does Hyprnote work?

Using Hyprnote is basically having a personal assistant just for your meetings but in a very private manner. Hyprnote will never betray you and hand over data to others.

      alt="Hyprnote Concept Left"
      title="Hyprnote Concept Left"
      noZoom={true}
    />
    Hyprnote will listen to everything you hear, while you take some quick
    notes.

      alt="Hyprnote Concept Right"
      title="Hyprnote Concept Right"
      noZoom={true}
    />
    Hyprnote crafts a personalized summary of the meeting by enhancing your
    notes.
