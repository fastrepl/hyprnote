Human eval.
E2E product tests

eval & data = key to high-quality AI products

**gather inputs**

1. build prototype internally
2. collect failures

doesn't need to perfectly represent

autofill -> a lot of employees used it for translations

even Notion cannot generate enough thumbs up/down

applicactions:
"your team needs to understadn the task the ai needs to perform, what are the dficulities"

whole datasets -=> ml -> clusters

indvidual logs <- LM

It pays off.

Engineers should look into the inputs.

ML eng. -> AI or LLM
evals should reflect users

Upskill existing eng. ex) notion ai team

1. ai-native apps
2. augmenting existing apps

**small amount of high-quality data**
1. prototype to validate use case

openai hires enormous amount of people
notion is on openai


1. interface to get things done ex. self-driving cars = get to destination, q&a
2. interface that helps how the process is done ex. ferrari, writing with notion


imge model space. -> wrap with buttons
langchain is too complicated

**really good logging**

2-3~5 steps.
no loops.
labeling party. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
HCI is repetivie

prompting is hard. regardless of how skilled you are.

textfields and searchbars seem to be just huge labor to users if it doesn't deliver good results. no matter what.
