Hyprnote uses [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) for most development tasks. See `**/Taskfile.yaml` for available commands.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Hyprnote, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (latest stable)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v20 or later)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) (v9 or later)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation)

## Mac

Install the required system dependencies via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cmake pkg-config
```

Install Rust if you haven't already:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote.git
cd hyprnote
pnpm install
```

Build the UI package before running the desktop app:

```bash
pnpm -F ui build
```

## Linux

For Ubuntu-based distributions, run the setup script:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-linux.sh
```

This script installs all required system dependencies including GTK, PulseAudio, and Tauri prerequisites. It also installs development tools like dprint, Taskfile, and Supabase CLI.

After running the setup script, clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote.git
cd hyprnote
pnpm install
```

## Next Steps

See [Run](/docs/developers/run) to learn how to start the development server, and [Environment Variables](/docs/developers/env) for configuration options.
