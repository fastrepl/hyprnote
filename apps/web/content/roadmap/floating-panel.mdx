A compact, always-on-top translucent panel that automatically appears when meetings start (can be disabled in settings). Designed to stay out of your way during meetings - no vivid notepad blocking participants or shared materials. Customize the transparency and blur to your preference. Navigate through four tabs: Notepad for quick notes, Transcript for live transcription, Insights for real-time summaries of the last 5 minutes plus sentiment analysis of speakers (are they happy, uncertain, etc.), and Chat to ask questions and get answers in real time.
