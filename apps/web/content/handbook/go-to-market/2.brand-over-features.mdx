We don't differentiate through features. We build a brand.

**Open Source Is a Brand** — People who love open source often cite transparency, security, or ownership. But at its core, it's preference — like choosing Philz over Starbucks. Open source is already a brand itself, and we embrace that identity fully.

**Cloud Isn't the Differentiator** — From a user's perspective, most AI notetakers are built on similar infrastructure — the same API providers, the same underlying models. Users don't choose based on whose cloud is better. They choose based on the experience, the values, and the trust they feel.

**Branding Is Reputation** — It's how people think about us. Not what we say we are, but what they believe we are. We earn that through consistency, transparency, and building something people genuinely want to use.

**Values Over Feature Lists** — We use terms like control, ownership, no lock-in, no strings attached. These aren't marketing copy — they're the principles that guide every decision. The features follow from the values, not the other way around.
