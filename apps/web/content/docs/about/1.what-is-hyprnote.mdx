Hyprnote is a privacy-first AI notepad for meetings. It's [open-source](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote), runs [locally](/docs/about/why-local-first), and works without bots joining your calls.

Key features:
- Transcribe and summarize locally or with your own models
- No data leaves your device unless you choose cloud features
- Built with [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) for native performance

## How It Works

  <Card title="During the meeting">

      alt="Hyprnote Concept Left"
      title="Hyprnote Concept Left"
      noZoom={true}
    />
    Hyprnote will listen to everything you hear, while you take some quick
    notes.

  <Card title="After the meeting">

      src="/images/hyprnote-concept-right.jpg"
      alt="Hyprnote Concept Right"
      title="Hyprnote Concept Right"
      noZoom={true}
    />
    Hyprnote crafts a personalized summary of the meeting by enhancing your
    notes.
