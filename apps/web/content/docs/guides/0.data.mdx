Hyprnote stores all data locally in a SQLite database. Nothing leaves your device unless you explicitly use cloud features.

## Data Location

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/hyprnote/` |

In development mode, the folder name changes to `com.hyprnote.dev` or `com.hyprnote.staging`.

## Directory Structure

```
hyprnote/
├── db.sqlite        # Notes, transcripts, metadata
├── settings.json    # App configuration
└── sessions/        # Audio recordings
```

## Export

Select any note and use the export option to save as Markdown, JSON, or plain text.

## Backup

Copy the entire data directory to back up your notes. Include this folder in your regular backup routine.
