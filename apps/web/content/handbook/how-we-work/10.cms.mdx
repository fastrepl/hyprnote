## Why MDX + GitHub

Files endure, interfaces change. The same philosophy that shapes Char shapes how we run the company.

Content lives as MDX files in Git — not locked in a proprietary database.

- **Ownership** — Plain text we control
- **Durability** — Markdown outlasts any CMS platform
- **Transparency** — Version-controlled and inspectable
- **Friction-free** — Edit in your IDE, push, done

We eat our own cooking. If users' notes should be files they own, our company content should be too.
