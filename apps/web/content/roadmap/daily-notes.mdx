A timeline view of your notes in reverse chronological order, like a Facebook timeline. Each day shows a collection of what you need to do and a summary of what you've done. Aggregates emails, tasks from integrated task management software, and meeting notes into one robust view. Track your progress as items get checked off throughout the day.
