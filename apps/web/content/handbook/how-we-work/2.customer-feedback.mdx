summary: "GitHub Issues and Projects is our main channel for feedback and prioritization, keeping us open-source friendly and transparent."

Early on, we had too many feedback channels — email, Intercom, Canny, Discord, GitHub, Linear. We've since streamlined. Today, GitHub is our main public channel, with everything else synced into it. This helps us stay open-source friendly, transparent, and focused.

## The Principle

The principle is simple: one source of truth, open to everyone.

## Our Channels

**GitHub** is our primary platform for user engagement and internal work tracking:

- **GitHub Discussions** for feedback requests and feature conversations
- **GitHub Issues** for bug reports and tracked work
- **GitHub Projects** for prioritization and the day-to-day operational board that the team pulls from

We use [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6) as our prioritized queue. Issues represent trackable work and bugs, Discussions are for exploratory feedback, and Projects is where we triage and prioritize what gets worked on next.

We do have other channels like Zendesk and Discord, and hope to streamline this further in the future with AI assistance.

**content-collections** (technically GitHub) powers our:

- Roadmaps
- Blog posts
- Documentation

This approach keeps everything in one ecosystem, making it easier for both our team and the community to stay aligned.
