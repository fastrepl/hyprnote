## Free Trial

New users can try Hyprnote Pro free for 14 days. During onboarding, select "Start Free Trial" to begin. The trial includes full access to all Pro features including cloud transcription and AI services. When your trial begins, you'll see a congratulatory modal confirming your Pro access.

## Activating a License

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase Pro License">
    Visit [hyprnote.com/pricing](/pricing) to purchase a Pro license. You'll receive a confirmation email with your license key in this format:

    ```bash
    key/******************************************
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter License Key">
    Open Hyprnote and go to Settings > Account. Paste your license key into the text input and click Activate. Your Pro features will be enabled immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

If you're logged out while using Pro features, you'll see a toast notification prompting you to log back in. Your Pro status is preserved across app restarts, but you'll need an active internet connection to validate your license periodically.
