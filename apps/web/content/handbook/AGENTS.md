# Handbook Guidelines

## Two Audiences

This handbook serves two audiences. Every page should be aware of which audience it primarily speaks to, though most pages will be read by both.

**Audience 1: People considering joining Char.** They want to understand how we think, what we value, and whether this is the right place for them. Sections that primarily serve this audience: About, Who We Want.

**Audience 2: People who just joined Char.** They need to know how we communicate, do work practically, and where we're heading. Sections that primarily serve this audience: How We Work (including team-specific mindset pages), Communication.

**Go To Market** is a shared section — it tells prospective teammates what our strategy looks like and gives new teammates the playbook they need to execute.

## Voice and Tone

- Direct and opinionated. Say what we mean. No hedge words ("we try to", "we believe we should").
- Short paragraphs. Favor bold claims followed by one or two sentences of reasoning.
- Write like you're explaining to a smart peer, not pitching to an investor.
- No corporate language. No "leverage", "synergize", "align stakeholders".
- Genuine over polished. It's okay to admit what we don't know or haven't figured out yet.

## Structure Rules

- Each page should earn its existence. If a page is under ~100 words of real content, fold it into a neighboring page.
- Don't repeat core beliefs across multiple pages. State them once in About (What We Believe), then reference or link from other pages. Repetition dilutes conviction.
- Frontmatter `summary` should be a single sentence that a candidate could read in a list view and know whether to click.
- Prefer concrete examples over abstract principles. "We use GitHub Issues, not Jira" is better than "We value transparency in project management."

## Transparency Boundaries

We are open source and default to transparency. But some things stay private:

- **Show freely:** How we think, how we work, what tools we use, what we believe, team culture, technical architecture decisions, open roles and compensation bands.
- **Keep private:** Specific client names and details, revenue numbers, runway, investor details, specific conversion metrics, anything that exposes individuals without consent.
- **Use judgment on:** Growth numbers (can share directional trends without exact figures), pricing details (public tiers are fine, but avoid exposing margin strategy), enterprise timelines (share general direction, not specific quarter targets that could age badly).

## Content Quality

- Every page should teach something or help someone make a decision. If it does neither, cut it.
- Avoid "what" without "why". Don't just list tools — explain why we chose them.
- When describing processes, include enough detail that a new teammate could actually follow them on day one.
- Keep onboarding pages practical and complete. Empty sections are worse than no section at all.

## Maintenance

- Review quarterly. Remove anything that's no longer true.
- Dates and quarter targets age poorly. Use relative language ("early stage", "next phase") or keep them updated.
- When the team grows, update pages that reference specific people or team size.
