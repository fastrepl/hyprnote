## Day 1: Get Set Up

### Accounts and Access

When you join, you'll get access to:

- **GitHub** — Added to the [fastrepl](https://github.com/fastrepl) org. This is where all code, issues, projects, and content live.
- **Slack** — Our lightweight coordination tool. Introduce yourself, ask questions, don't be shy.
- **Hyprnote admin** — Sign in at `https://hyprnote.com/admin` with your authorized email for content management.

### Dev Environment

We recommend [Cursor](https://cursor.com) if you don't have a specific IDE preference. Other tools we use: Zed, GitButler, Claude Code.

## Day 1 Checklist

- [ ] GitHub org access confirmed
- [ ] Slack joined, introduced yourself
- [ ] Dev environment set up (IDE installed, repo cloned, builds locally)
- [ ] Read this handbook — seriously, all of it
- [ ] Downloaded a staging build and opened Hyprnote

## Days 2-3: Get Familiar

- [ ] Use Hyprnote in your own meetings
- [ ] Browse [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6) to understand current priorities
- [ ] Read through recent PRs to understand what's being worked on
- [ ] Make a test PR (fix a typo, improve a doc, anything)

## Week 1: Ship Something

This is the most important part. **Ship something real in your first week.** A bug fix, a small feature, a piece of content, a design improvement — it doesn't matter what, as long as it's real and merged.

- [ ] Pick a task from GitHub Projects or find something that bugs you
- [ ] Ship it via PR
- [ ] Get it reviewed and merged

Shipping fast builds momentum and helps you understand the codebase, the review process, and the team. Don't wait until you feel "ready" — you learn by doing.

## Week 2: Own Something

- [ ] Take ownership of a task from the current sprint
- [ ] Attend (or listen to recording of) the next planning sync
- [ ] Start forming opinions about what should be better

## Staging Builds

Staging builds are created when testing new features before they go to nightly or stable releases.

**Easiest method:**

1. Go to the [Download Latest Staging Build workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/download_staging.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the platform (currently `macos-aarch64` for Apple Silicon Macs)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Once complete, download the artifact from the workflow run

Staging builds are stored in R2 with filenames like `hyprnote-staging-{timestamp}-{commit}-macos-aarch64.dmg`.

**Alternative:** Download directly from [desktop_cd workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml) artifacts — look for `hyprnote-staging-macos-silicon`.

## Triggering Staging Builds

**From a PR:** Comment `/staging` on the PR. The bot will trigger a staging build and reply with a link to the workflow run.

**Manually:**

1. Go to [desktop_cd.yaml workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch and choose "staging" as the channel
4. Click "Run workflow"

## Questions?

Ask in Slack. There are no dumb questions, especially in your first two weeks. If the answer isn't documented, that's a bug — fix it by adding it to the handbook via PR.
