Own your work. Move fast. Communicate openly. We don't micromanage — we trust you to figure things out. In return: autonomy, impact, and the chance to build something meaningful.

## Open Positions

We're hiring for roles where you'll have real ownership and impact from day one.

**[Designteer](/jobs/designteer)** — Own visual quality across product and marketing. Design and ship real UI, not just mockups. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used. We need a designer who codes, ships fast, and cares about craft. Compensation: `$80 ~ 120k/year` + `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity.

## What to Expect

Remote-first. Async via Slack. Everything runs through GitHub. Read [How We Work](/company-handbook/how-we-work/work-styles/) for the full picture, and the [Onboarding Guide](/company-handbook/onboarding/getting-started/) when you're ready to get set up.
