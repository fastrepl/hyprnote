We use GitHub Actions cron jobs to automate recurring tasks. These workflows run on a schedule and use Devin AI to handle the work.

## Weekly Blog Post

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 12:00 UTC

Analyzes git commits and changelogs from the past 7 days, then writes a "Char Weekly" blog post summarizing what shipped. Created as a PR for review before publishing.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_weekly_blog.yaml`

## Daily Documentation Update

**Schedule:** Every day at 00:00 UTC

Reviews recent code changes and updates technical documentation to keep it in sync with the codebase. Checks for new features, API changes, and developer-facing updates.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_update_docs.yaml`

## Daily Clippy Fixes

**Schedule:** Every day at 00:00 UTC

Runs `cargo clippy --fix` to automatically apply Rust linting suggestions, then creates a PR with the fixes.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_cargo_clippy.yaml`

## Monthly Legal Review

**Schedule:** First day of every month at 00:00 UTC

Reviews product changes from the past 30 days and flags anything with potential legal implications (data collection, third-party integrations, privacy changes). Creates a report for human review — never automatically modifies legal documents.

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/devin_review_legal.yaml`

## Manual Triggers

All workflows can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions tab using `workflow_dispatch`.
