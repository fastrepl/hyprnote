## Downloading Staging Builds

Staging builds are created when testing new features before they go to nightly or stable releases.

**Easiest method:**

1. Go to the [Download Latest Staging Build workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/actions/workflows/download_staging.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the platform (currently `macos-aarch64` for Apple Silicon Macs)
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Once complete, download the artifact from the workflow run

Staging builds are stored in R2 with filenames like `hyprnote-staging-{timestamp}-{commit}-macos-aarch64.dmg`.

**Alternative:** Download directly from [desktop_cd workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml) artifacts — look for `hyprnote-staging-macos-silicon`.

## Triggering Staging Builds

**From a PR:** Comment `/staging` on the PR. The bot will trigger a staging build and reply with a link to the workflow run.

**Manually:**

1. Go to [desktop_cd.yaml workflow](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/actions/workflows/desktop_cd.yaml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select the branch and choose "staging" as the channel
4. Click "Run workflow"
