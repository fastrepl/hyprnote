# File Transcription

- If using Cloud provider, any file supported by the provider can be transcribed. See [Better Transcription](/docs/pro/better-transcription) for available cloud providers.
- If using Local provider, anything that can be decoded by `rodio` with `symphonia-all` enabled can be transcribed. See [Local Models](/docs/developers/local-models) for local STT model details.
