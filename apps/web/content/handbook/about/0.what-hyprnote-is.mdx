Char is an open-source AI notetaker. Use any model — on-device or cloud. Keep your data as files on your disk. No vendor lock-in, no subscription treadmill.

## Beyond Note-Taking

Note-taking reduces cognitive load. We're extending that idea: what other cognitive burdens can we offload? Today it's meeting notes. Tomorrow, email, calendar, and broader workflow — an AI-native executive assistant that actually works for you.

Char combines two capabilities: **AI notetaking** (the foundation — capturing and understanding meetings) and **AI assistant** (the superpower — taking action on that understanding). Learn more in [Product Philosophy](/company-handbook/about/product-philosophy/).

## Why This Matters

Most AI tools force you into their ecosystem, their models, their rules. We think there's a better path: open source, local-first, file-based. Your notes should survive us. See [What We Believe](/company-handbook/about/what-we-believe/) for the convictions behind these choices.
