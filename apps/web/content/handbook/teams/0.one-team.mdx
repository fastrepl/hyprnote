summary: "We have many functions but one team — everyone works across boundaries."

We don't have separate departments. We have one team with many functions.

Everyone at Char works cross-functionally. Engineers think about the user journey. Product people read the code. Marketers use the product daily. Growth is everyone's job.

The pages in this section describe the mindset for each function — not separate teams, but different lenses through which the same team looks at the same problems. You'll wear multiple hats. That's the point.

When you're writing code, think like the [Engineering](/company-handbook/teams/engineering/) page describes. When you're thinking about what to build next, think like the [Product](/company-handbook/teams/product/) page. When you're writing a blog post, think like [Content and Marketing](/company-handbook/teams/content-and-marketing/). When you're looking at the funnel, think like [Growth](/company-handbook/teams/growth/).

One team. Many lenses. No silos.
