Most “free” transcription tools aren’t genuinely free. They cap you at a few minutes max, force upgrades after trials, or lock essential features behind paywalls.

This guide focuses on tools with truly generous free plans that provide real usability for your specific needs.

## How We Chose These Tools

We evaluated dozens of transcription tools and selected these five based on what actually matters for free users:

- **Automatic transcription only**: Manual transcription assistants, which just help you type faster while listening to audio, were excluded. This guide focuses on software that actually transcribes for you.
- **Genuine free access**: We prioritized tools with permanent free plans, not trials disguised as “free” offerings. Each tool on this list provides ongoing access to core transcription features without requiring payment.
- **Usable limitations**: Many “free” tools impose restrictions that make them unusable, like 10-minute one-time trials or 3-minute recording limits. We focused on tools where the free tier actually works for real-world use cases.
- **Transcription quality**: All selected tools use modern AI models (primarily OpenAI’s Whisper or similar) that deliver genuine accuracy, not outdated speech recognition that requires extensive manual correction.
- **Privacy and data handling**: We noted whether tools process locally or in the cloud, and whether your data gets used for AI training.
- **No hidden costs**: We clearly documented where free plans end and paid features begin, so you know exactly what you’re getting.

## Popular Transcription Tools We Didn’t Include (and Why)

### 1. Rev

[Rev](https://www.rev.com) only offers 45 minutes of AI transcription per month on the free plan, which most regular users exhaust within days.

### 5. Otter.ai

[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai) offers 300 minutes per month with a 30-minute limit per recording, but forces cloud processing and includes visible meeting bots.

You get AI-powered features without giving up ownership of your data. You get enterprise-grade functionality without vendor lock-in. You get ease of use without sacrificing flexibility.

This isn’t a bait and switch. You can try the tool out for free, and if you decide it’s not for you, just export everything and walk away. That’s the deal!
