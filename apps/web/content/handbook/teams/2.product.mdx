## Mindset

Product at Char is about taste and judgment. We have strong opinions about how software should feel — and we expect everyone working on product to develop those opinions too.

## Principles

**User journey obsession** — Every feature, every screen, every interaction is part of a journey: onboarding → activation → retention. Ask yourself: does this make Char stickier? Does this reduce friction?

**Reduce cognitive load** — Our product exists to take burden off people. The product itself should never add burden. If something requires explanation, it's probably too complex.

**Human-first design** — AI assists, humans decide. The user should always feel in control. We say "notetaking" not "notetaker" — the human is active, the AI is the tool.

**Remove more than you add** — Simplicity is a feature. When in doubt, cut scope. A focused product that does one thing exceptionally well beats a bloated one that does many things adequately.

## Cross-Functional

Product people at Char should be technical. Read the code, understand the architecture, know what's feasible. The best product decisions come from people who can prototype, not just spec.
