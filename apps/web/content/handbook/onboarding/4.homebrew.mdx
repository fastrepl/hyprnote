## What It Is

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for macOS. Think of it as an app store that runs in your terminal — you type a command, and it installs software for you. Almost every other tool in our stack is installed through Homebrew.

## Install

Open your terminal (press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", hit Enter) and paste this:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Follow the prompts. It will ask for your Mac password — that's normal.

**Important:** After installation finishes, Homebrew will print a "Next steps" message with two commands to add Homebrew to your PATH. Run both of them. If you skip this, `brew` commands won't work.

## Verify

Close and reopen your terminal, then run:

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like `Homebrew 4.x.x`. If you get "command not found", you missed the PATH step above — scroll back in your terminal and run those two commands.

## Basics

```bash
brew install <package>     # Install something
brew update                # Update Homebrew itself
brew upgrade               # Upgrade all installed packages
brew list                  # See what's installed
```

You'll use `brew install` frequently during the rest of this setup.
