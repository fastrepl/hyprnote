## What It Is

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev) is a modern terminal application. If you've never used a terminal before, think of it as a text-based interface to your computer — you type commands instead of clicking buttons. Warp makes this less intimidating with features like autocomplete, AI command search, and a clean interface.

## Why a Terminal?

Even non-engineers need a terminal at Char. You'll use it to:

- Install tools (via Homebrew)
- Run the website locally to preview content changes
- Use Claude Code for AI-assisted editing
- Push code/content changes

Warp makes all of this easier than the default Mac terminal.

## Install

```bash
brew install --cask warp
```

Or download from [warp.dev](https://www.warp.dev).

If you don't have Homebrew yet, install Warp from the website first, then use Warp to [install Homebrew](/handbook/onboarding/homebrew).

## First Launch

1. Open Warp
2. Sign in (free account)
3. It will ask to be your default terminal — say yes

## Key Features

**AI Command Search** — Press `Ctrl + ~` (or click the AI icon) and describe what you want to do in plain English. Warp will suggest the right command.

**Autocomplete** — Start typing a command and Warp suggests completions. Press Tab to accept.

**Blocks** — Each command and its output is grouped into a "block". You can copy, share, or bookmark individual blocks.

**Workflows** — Save frequently used commands as reusable workflows.

## Essential Commands

If you're new to the terminal, here are the commands you'll use most:

```bash
cd <folder>       # Go to a folder (e.g., cd ~/Dev/hyprnote)
ls                # List files in the current folder
pwd               # Show where you are
```

You don't need to memorize much beyond this. Use Warp's AI search for everything else, or use Claude Code which handles commands for you.

## macOS Permissions

Warp needs some system permissions to work with Char in development:

1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
2. Grant Warp access to **Microphone** (for testing audio features)
3. Grant Warp access to **Accessibility** (for system-level features)

See the [developer setup docs](/docs/developers/setup) for more details on permissions.
