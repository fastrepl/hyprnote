Dedicated hardware for ambient listening that's non-intrusive. A phone or voice recorder on the desk signals to others that the conversation might be recorded, making it unnatural. Our vision: an e-ink tablet like Kindle or Remarkable that you write on, with a built-in mic that listens to conversations. Syncs via WiFi or Bluetooth to your phone and optionally to the cloud. Also exploring a pendant, ring, and pen form factors - all designed to blend naturally into your environment.
