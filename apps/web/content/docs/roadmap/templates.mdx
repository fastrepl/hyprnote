## What we currently have

Templates are pre-defined strucuturs for meeting summary notes that you can feed in to AI. A template consists of an overall description and sub sections. After reading those, AI will summarize your meeting note following the exact structure you want.

### Default Templates (Free Plan)

We have prepared a wide range of different templates for you, so that you can always enhance your meeting notes based on the situation and occasion. For example, we have templates for Daily Standup, Coffee Chat, Therapy Session, Job Interview and more.
