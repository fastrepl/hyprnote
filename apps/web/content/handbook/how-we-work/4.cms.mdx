## GitHub

## Decap

* We use [Decap CMS](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms) for non-technical editors.

### Developer

* All config stored in `apps/web/public/admin`, and accessible at `https://hyprnote.com/admin`. (this is not accessible in `dev` mode)
* We use [GitHub](https://decapcms.org/docs/github-backend) as storage backend, with [Netlify Git Gateway](https://docs.netlify.com/manage/security/secure-access-to-sites/git-gateway) to authenticate users.
* New users should be invited at `https://app.netlify.com/projects/hyprnote/configuration/identity#users`.
