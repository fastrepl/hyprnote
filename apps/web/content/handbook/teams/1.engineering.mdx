## Mindset

Engineers at Char own the full picture — not just the code, but the product and the user experience. You should understand why something is being built, not just how.

## How We Build

**Open source by default** — Our codebase is public. Write code you'd be proud to show the world.

**Rust + TypeScript** — Rust for the backend and core systems (Tauri), TypeScript and React for the frontend. This stack gives us performance, safety, and developer ergonomics.

**Ship fast, iterate** — Don't over-engineer. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.

**AI-augmented** — We use Devin, Claude Code, and Cursor as daily tools. Treat AI like a capable colleague — delegate routine work, review the output.

## Code Review

All changes go through PRs. Reviews should be fast and focused — don't block on style preferences, focus on correctness and clarity. If you're waiting on a review for more than a few hours, ping on Slack.

## Cross-Functional

Engineers should talk to users, read feedback in GitHub Discussions, and understand the product roadmap. The best technical decisions come from understanding the problem, not just the implementation.
