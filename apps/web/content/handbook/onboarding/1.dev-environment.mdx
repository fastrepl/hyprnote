## Overview

Follow the [developer setup guide](/docs/developers/setup) for full prerequisites and installation steps. This page covers the parts that trip people up most often.

## Local Supabase

We use a **local Supabase instance** (powered by Docker) during development. You do not need production Supabase keys — everything is generated locally.

```bash
task supabase-start
```

This will:

1. Start a local Supabase server in Docker
2. Generate `.env.supabase` at the repo root with all necessary keys (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, etc.)
3. Run pending migrations

See [Environment Variables](/docs/developers/env) for the full list of generated variables.

## GitHub Login (OAuth)

To enable the GitHub login flow locally, use [Infisical](https://infisical.com/docs/cli/commands/login) to inject the dev-only OAuth credentials:

```bash
infisical run --env=dev --projectId=87dad7b5-72a6-4791-9228-b3b86b169db1 --path="/supabase" -- task supabase-start
```

This sets `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` for a dev-only GitHub OAuth app, so GitHub login works against your local Supabase.

Without these credentials, `task supabase-start` still works — you just won't be able to test GitHub OAuth login.

See the [Login docs](/docs/developers/login) for more details on authentication setup.

## Running the App

```bash
pnpm -F ui build && pnpm -F desktop tauri dev
```

See [Run](/docs/developers/run) for all available dev commands (desktop, web, API, etc.).

## Common Issues

**"I can't log in / I don't have the Supabase keys"** — You don't need production keys. Run `task supabase-start` to spin up a local Supabase instance that generates all the keys automatically.

**"GitHub login doesn't work"** — You need the dev-only OAuth credentials from Infisical. See the [GitHub Login](#github-login-oauth) section above.

**"Cursor can't connect to the network when indexing"** — Ensure you have a stable internet connection and restart Cursor. If the issue persists, you can still work by browsing the code directly.
