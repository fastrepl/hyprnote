We believe in building in public and letting our work speak for itself. People choose us for two main reasons: they have high intent and are actively searching for a solution, or they trust someone who recommended us.

## Discovery Channels

**SEO and content** — Blog posts, documentation, and educational content that ranks well for relevant searches. This captures high-intent users who are actively looking for solutions.

**Reddit** — Authentic engagement in relevant communities where people discuss productivity tools and note-taking.

**LinkedIn** — Professional network presence for reaching knowledge workers and enterprise users.

**X (Twitter)** — Building in public and engaging with the tech community. Word of mouth from respected voices in the community has been particularly effective.

**TikTok** — Short-form content that reaches a broader audience. Shoutouts from tech influencers have driven meaningful traffic.

**Open source community** — Our GitHub presence and contributions to the ecosystem build trust and credibility.

**Friends and colleagues** — Personal recommendations remain one of our strongest channels.

## Two Types of Discovery

We think about customer acquisition in two buckets: **high-intent discovery** (SEO, Reddit, LinkedIn) where people are actively searching for solutions, and **social proof discovery** (X, TikTok, word of mouth) where people trust others and give us a try. Both are important, and we invest in maintaining presence across both.

## Staying Healthy

When impressions drop, we investigate site health and content cadence. We invest in coaching and operational help when needed, and we experiment with new platforms and content formats (like funny, informative videos on YouTube and TikTok) to keep our reach growing.
