Multiple users can edit notes simultaneously with live updates.

## Implementation

We're building WebSocket-based real-time collaboration with the following components:

- WebSocket server infrastructure - https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/120
- Live cursor tracking - https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/121
- Conflict resolution with CRDT - https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/122
- User presence indicators - https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/123
