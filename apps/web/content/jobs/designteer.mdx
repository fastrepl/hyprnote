<Collapsible title="What's a Designteer?">
**designteer** /dɪˈzɛn.tɪr/ _noun_ [ C ]

a person who designs interfaces, ships marketing campaigns, and writes code, typically found debugging CSS at 2am while simultaneously running A/B tests

_Compare:_ **engigner** /ˈɛn.dʒɪ.nər/ _noun_ [ C ] - a rare species like <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> who engineers products, designs systems, and manages roadmaps, often spotted merging their own PRs

## You won't get along with us

- If you only want to design in Figma
- If you prefer mockups over shipping
- If you skip quality to move fast
- If you need process to make progress
- If you don't want to do marketing
- If you want a short-term role

## Why we need your help

Hyprnote is product-led. Design execution is our bottleneck - visual quality depends too much on the founder. **We need someone to own design across product and marketing.**

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

## What you'll be doing

Own visual quality across product, website, and marketing. Design and ship real UI. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used.

Success: the product feels calmer + more solid, marketing doesn't wait on the founder, design decisions feel obvious.

## Who we want to meet

A designer who codes and ships. Fast, independent, uncompromising on quality. Interested in marketing and storytelling. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## How we work

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack. Occasional calls with <HyprnoteIcon /> Hyprnote on. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub - [bug reports](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/issues), [feature requests](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/discussions), [code review](https://github.com/fastrepl/char/pulls), and [project management](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6).

You must be comfortable with <ToolIcon icon="logos:figma" /> Figma, basic video editing, and a huge plus if you can code.

You will work directly with <GitHubMention username="ComputelessComputer" name="John" /> and <GitHubMention username="harshikaalagh-netizen" name="Harshika" />.

## How we compensate

Ballpark: `$80 ~ 120k/year` + `0.5 ~ 1.5%` equity. Depends on scope and experience.

Early, high-ownership role. You'll grow with the company.

## How to apply

Click on the apply button and tell me three things:

2. Short story: Tell me the most interesting thing you've made - literally anything is possible

But really the above is just a guideline - feel free to surprise us with your unique format!

## How we hire

1. Apply by email: We'll review your application and reply within 48 hours ONLY if we think you're interesting.
2. 20-min intro: An introductory chat about our team and getting to know each other. You'll get a reply within 24 hours with follow-up questions. You can answer via video call or _email_ (which we prefer so we can make the most of our time together).
3. 30-min follow-up: We'll ask a bunch of questions, but don't hesitate to ask us too! We love questions and want to discuss things together. After all, this is a startup and lots of stuff needs to be figured out.
4. Take-home assignment: You'll have a week to propose a solution to a design problem. These are practical challenges like designing a landing page or a new settings tab for our desktop app - real issues on our mind. They're all open-ended, and some don't even have a low-fidelity design yet. It's up to you to figure out the best approach.
5. Negotiation: We'll negotiate salary and benefits based on your experience and skills, including the equity package and other perks.
