## Local-first > Cloud-first

No loading spinners, no sync conflicts, no "reconnecting..." toasts. Local-first apps just work.

## Your Data, Your Rules

Cloud tools log everything. Local-first means your data stays on your machine unless you explicitly sync. You own the files. You control the backups.

This matters for confidential meeting notes, client intel, and anything you wouldn't want indexed.

<Info>
  Hyprnote collects usage analytics and error logs by default. You can opt-out anytime in Settings.

## Works Offline

Local tools don't care about your connection. Record and transcribe meetings on planes, trains, or hotel Wi-Fi without issues.

## Best of Both Worlds

Want collaboration? Use self-hosted sync or cloud features when you need them, while keeping local-first benefits.
