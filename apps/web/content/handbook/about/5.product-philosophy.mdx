## AI Notetaking vs AI Assistant

Hyprnote has two core capabilities that work together but serve different purposes:

**AI Notetaking** — A notepad that uses AI to improve the notetaking experience in meetings. Real-time transcription during meetings, intelligent summaries when meetings end. We call this "notetaking" rather than "notetaker" because we put humans first. You're actively taking notes with AI assistance — not passively letting a bot do it for you. Our most enthusiastic users describe this as "hybrid notetaking" or "AI notetaking."

**AI Assistant** — Goes beyond the meeting itself. While notetaking reacts to what happens in the meeting, the assistant is proactive. It gathers context from outside the meeting, executes follow-up tasks, and helps you act on what you learned. This is how Hyprnote scales beyond simple note-taking.

Think of it this way:
- **AI notetaking** is the foundation — capturing and understanding what happens
- **AI assistant** is the superpower — taking action on that understanding

## Human-First Design

We deliberately chose "notetaking" over "notetaker" because agency matters. A "notetaker" implies something passive — a bot that records while you sit back. "Notetaking" implies you're in control, actively engaged, with AI as your tool.

This isn't just semantics. It reflects our core belief: AI should reduce cognitive load, not replace human judgment. You remain central. The AI works for you, not the other way around.

## Agency Is Encouraged and Celebrated

We build for people with high agency — those who want control over their tools, their data, and their workflows. This means:

- **You choose the AI** — On-device, cloud, or your own models
- **You own the data** — Files on your disk, not locked in our servers
- **You decide the workflow** — Customize templates, automate what you want, keep manual what you prefer

We're not building a system you work inside. We're building a tool that works for you.
