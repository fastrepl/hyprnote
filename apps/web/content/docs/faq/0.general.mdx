## What is Hyprnote?

Hyprnote is a desktop notetaking application that captures both your microphone and system audio. It uses local AI to transcribe conversations, generate summaries, and help you organize your notes - all while keeping your data private on your device.

## How is Hyprnote different from other meeting recorders?

Unlike bot-based recorders that join your meetings, Hyprnote runs locally on your computer and captures audio directly from your system. This means it works with any application, doesn't require meeting permissions, and keeps all your data private.
