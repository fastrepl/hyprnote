## Mindset

Growth at Char is product-led. We don't cold-call developers. We build something great, make it easy to try, and let the product speak for itself.

## Principles

**Reduce friction everywhere** — Every step of the user journey should be scrutinized for unnecessary friction. Can someone get value from Char in under 5 minutes? If not, something is broken.

**Awareness → Acquisition → Activation → Retention** — These aren't separate departments. They're a unified flow that every team member should understand. Growth touches everything.

**Bottoms-up adoption** — End users advocate for the product inside their companies. The best way into organizations is through individuals who love it and champion it internally.

**Measure what matters** — Focus on activation and retention over vanity metrics. A thousand active daily users who love the product beats a million downloads that churn.

## Cross-Functional

Growth is everyone's job. Engineers should think about onboarding friction. Designers should think about first-run experience. Marketers should think about what happens after someone lands on the website. The user journey is one continuous thread.
