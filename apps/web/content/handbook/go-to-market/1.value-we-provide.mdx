We give people back their focus and autonomy. Be fully present in conversations with complete control over your AI and data.

## Core Value

**Bring Your Own Key** — If you already have API credits from OpenAI, Anthropic, or other providers, why pay twice? Hyprnote lets you use your existing keys instead of forcing you onto another subscription. This builds trust and reinforces everything we stand for.

## What You Get

**Freedom of choice** — Any AI model. On-device, cloud, or both. No lock-in to our models.

**True ownership** — Your data stays yours. Files on your disk, not opaque blobs behind an API. Local-first means you're never dependent on our servers.

**Time savings** — No manual note-taking or post-meeting docs. Focus on the conversation.

**Better recall** — Searchable transcripts, nothing gets lost. The filesystem becomes your memory.

**Simplicity** — Powerful features that feel effortless. One thing done exceptionally well.
