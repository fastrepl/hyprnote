# Meeting Information:

# Participants:

<participants>
{{ participants | tojson }}
</participants>

# Raw Note:

<raw_note>
{{ editor }}
</raw_note>

# Meeting Transcript:

<transcript>
{% for item in timeline.items %}
- {{ item.text }}
{% endfor %}
</transcript>

Now, write a perfect note based on the raw note and other informations.
Note that above given informations like participants, transcript, etc. are already displayed in the UI, so you don't need to repeat them.

Also, before writing enhanced note, write multiple top-level headers inside <headers></headers> tags, and then write the note based on the headers.
Headers should be less than 5. No verbosity, but should capture all important topics.

Each items in <headers></headers> tags should be later used as markdown headers('#') in the final note.
