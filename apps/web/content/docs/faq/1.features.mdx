## What apps does Hyprnote work with?

Hyprnote works with any application on your computer - Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Discord, and more. It captures system audio, so it doesn't depend on specific integrations.

## Can I record in-person conversations?

Yes! Hyprnote captures your microphone input, so you can record in-person meetings, phone calls, or any conversation where you're using your computer's microphone.

## What languages does Hyprnote support?

Hyprnote supports transcription and AI features in 45+ languages including:

**Major Languages:**

- English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean

**European Languages:**

- Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Romanian, Czech, Slovak, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Greek, Danish, Ukrainian, Turkish

**Other Languages:**

- Arabic, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Thai, Tagalog, Tamil, Hindi, Hebrew, Azerbaijani, Catalan, Galician, Macedonian, Bosnian, Estonian, Slovenian, Latvian, Lithuanian

You can select your main language and add additional spoken languages in the app's settings under "Language & Vocabulary". The main language is used for summaries, chats, and AI-generated responses, while spoken languages help improve transcription accuracy when multiple languages are used in a meeting.

## Can I undo deleting a session?

Yes! When you delete a session, a toast notification appears giving you 5 seconds to undo the deletion. Simply click "Undo" in the toast to restore the session with all its content, including transcripts, enhanced notes, and participants.

## Can I change the timezone for the sidebar?

By default, Hyprnote uses your system timezone to display session times in the sidebar timeline. If you need to override this (for example, when traveling or working across time zones), go to **Settings** > **General** and select a different timezone from the dropdown. Choose "System" to revert to automatic detection.
