We balance independence with frequent sync. Too much disturbance kills focus; too little sync causes drift. Even with async work, flooding Slack channels with long threads reduces readability and creates noise. We've learned to be intentional about where information lives.

## Our Tools

**GitHub Issues and Projects** is our single source of truth for work intake and prioritization. We document decisions, track tasks, and prioritize work in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6). Team members pick up tasks from there. This keeps everything transparent and reduces the need to dig through chat history.

**Slack** for lightweight coordination and quick clarification. We avoid posting long updates or decisions in Slack — those belong in GitHub. For detailed discussions that need real-time back-and-forth, we use Slack huddles.

**Devin** as our AI software engineer. We have a dedicated product-with-devin channel in Slack where we transparently assign tasks and collaborate. We treat Devin like a colleague or intern — sometimes Yujong takes over when deeper coding expertise is needed, but mostly it's a transparent workflow where anyone can see what's being worked on.

**GitHub** also serves as our CMS — our IDEs double as blog editors. Want to write something? Just submit a PR with your article. Related posts:

## Escalation Ladder

Not everything is equally urgent. We use a simple escalation ladder: phone calls are reserved for truly urgent matters that can't wait; Slack mentions are for things that are reasonably urgent but can wait a few hours; and everything else goes into GitHub for async processing. This helps us protect focus time while ensuring nothing critical falls through the cracks.

## AI-Augmented Team

We're automating as much as possible with AI and Hyprnote. Yujong has been heavily adopting AI into his workflow, and we believe a small, mission-aligned team augmented with AI can outperform companies with hundreds of people.
