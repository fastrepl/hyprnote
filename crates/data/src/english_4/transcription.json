After the meeting, it combines your notes with the transcript to generate a clean context where summary. In fact, note taking is optional, but it does help Hyprnote understand what you think is important. We also take privacy and seamlessness seriously. That's why Hyprnote is built local first.",

We made it simple enough for anyone to use right out of the box. But for those of you who need more functionality, we offer a wide variety of extensions from real time transcripts to instantly uploading those to CRMs like Twenty.",
