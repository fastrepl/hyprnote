# Development

> How to run the app?

- We use `pnpm` for workspace management and package management.

## Desktop (apps/desktop)

```bash
npx turbo -F @hypr/desktop tauri:dev
```

or

```bash
pnpm -F ui build && pnpm -F desktop tauri dev
```

## Web (apps/web)

```bash
pnpm -F web dev
```

## API Server (apps/api)

```bash
cargo run -p api
```

The API server (formerly `apps/ai`) handles LLM proxying (via OpenRouter), STT proxying, calendar integration, subscriptions, and the in-app support chat MCP server. See [Environment Variables](/docs/developers/env) for required configuration.

# Supabase

- https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started

```bash
task supabase-start
task supabase-stop
```

- `task supabase-start` will modify `apps/api/.env` and `apps/web/.env` based on the output of `supabase start`.
- We generate `supabase/config.toml` dynamically based on the environment variables, and it is `gitignored`.
- Currently, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` is supported to enable `GitHub OAuth`.
- It is important to set `<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/callback` as redirect URI in your OAuth application settings.

## Stripe

- Stripe CLI: https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli/install

```bash
task stripe
```

- `task stripe` will modify `apps/api/.env` based on the output of `stripe listen`.

## Stripe Webhook Service (apps/stripe)

```bash
pnpm -F stripe dev
```

This runs the dedicated Stripe webhook handler on Bun (default port 8788). It processes Stripe webhook events for subscription and entitlement management. See [Environment Variables](/docs/developers/env) for required configuration.
