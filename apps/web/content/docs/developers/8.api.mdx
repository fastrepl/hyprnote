## API Reference

The Hyprnote API provides endpoints for various functionalities used by the application. The API is categorized into three types:

- **Internal**: Endpoints for health checks and monitoring
- **App**: Endpoints used by the Hyprnote application (requires authentication)
- **Webhook**: Endpoints for external service callbacks (e.g., Stripe)

## Authentication

Most API endpoints require authentication using a Supabase JWT token. Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-supabase-jwt-token>
```
