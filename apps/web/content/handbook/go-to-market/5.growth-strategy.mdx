Bottoms-up, product-led growth (PLG) is the right playbook for Hyprnote.

## Why PLG Works for Us

One thing we firmly believe from our experiments — where we tried to drive top-down enterprise sales — is that this is a product that end users need to advocate inside the company. The best way to get into organizations is through individual users who love the product and champion it internally.

Being open source gives us this advantage. It's how other great products like PostHog and Vercel made their way into the market.

## Ideal User Journey

1. **Onboarding window pops up** — First impression matters
2. **User signs up** — Though we do offer an option to get started without logging in
3. **Grants access to permissions** — Microphone, calendar integrations
4. **Main window pops up** — User sees the core product
5. **Pro trial starts immediately** — Shortening time-to-value is critical

The key insight: we want to minimize friction and maximize the speed at which users experience value.

## Enterprise Later

We hope to focus on enterprise again in Q3. By then, we'll have a strong base of individual advocates who can champion Hyprnote within their organizations.
