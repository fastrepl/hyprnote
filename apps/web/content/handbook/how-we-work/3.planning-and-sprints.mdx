summary: "Monthly planning, weekly sprints, one core feature per stable release."

Focused cycles. Structure with flexibility.

## Stable vs Nightly

**Stable** — Polished, user-facing. Each release should make the app genuinely stickier — a real improvement, not just a version bump.

**Nightly** — Internal testing, rapid iteration. Break things here so stable stays solid.

## Cadence

Monthly in-person planning. Define focus and outcomes for the next stable release. Kanban-style board in [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/fastrepl/projects/6) gives visibility into what's in flight.

Weekly sprints within the larger cycle. Clear requirements and deliverables.

## Principles

- **One core feature per stable** — Anchor each release with one significant improvement
- **Habit loop focus** — Make Char indispensable before expanding scope
- **Huddles for discussion** — Real-time collaboration over lengthy async threads when decisions need to happen fast
- **Ship and iterate** — Good and shipped beats waiting for perfect
