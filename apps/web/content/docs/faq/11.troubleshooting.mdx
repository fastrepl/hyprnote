## Keychain Password Prompts (macOS)

If you see repeated password prompts asking for access to keychain items like `com.hyprnote.Argmax.licenseToken` or similar entries, this is typically caused by outdated or corrupted keychain entries from a previous version of Hyprnote.

### How to Fix

1. Open **Keychain Access** (search for it in Spotlight or find it in Applications > Utilities)
2. In the search bar, type `hyprnote` or `argmax`
3. Select and delete any Hyprnote or Argmax related entries
4. Quit Hyprnote completely and relaunch the app

The app will create fresh keychain entries on the next launch, and the password prompts should stop appearing.

### Why This Happens

When Hyprnote updates, sometimes the code signing identity changes, which can cause macOS to treat the new version as a different application. This triggers keychain access prompts because macOS is protecting your stored credentials from unauthorized access.
