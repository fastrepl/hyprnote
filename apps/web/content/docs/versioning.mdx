title: Versioning
description: How Hyprnote handles versioning for desktop releases
---

# Overview

- Before `v1.0.0`, we use `tauri.conf.json` to manage the base version, and use mix of `git tags` and `workflow inputs` to manage the release channels.
- From `v1.0.0`, we make all version compliant with [semver](https://semver.org/), \
using [doxxer](https://github.com/karlis-vagalis/doxxer) to automate the versioning process. (Configuration is in `doxxer.desktop.toml`)
- All version information is stored as `git tags`, and injected to `tauri.conf.json` in build time.
This also means `version` field in `tauri.conf.json` is not managed at all. 

# Format

- `1.0.0-nightly.1` -> `1.0.0-nightly.2` -> `1.0.0`
- `1.0.0` -> `1.0.1-nightly.1` -> `1.0.1-nightly.2` -> `1.0.1`

```bash
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml current         # current

doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next dev        # staging
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next pre-patch  # nightly
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next patch      # stable patch
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next minor      # stable minor
doxxer --config doxxer.desktop.toml next major      # stable major
```
