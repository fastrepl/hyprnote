## What are the system requirements?

Hyprnote requires macOS 12.0 or later with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) or Intel processor. We recommend at least 8GB of RAM for optimal performance with local AI features.

## How much storage space does Hyprnote need?

The app itself is about 200MB. Recording storage depends on your usage - a 1-hour meeting uses approximately 50-100MB. We recommend having at least 5GB of free space.

## Does Hyprnote work offline?

Yes! Since Hyprnote uses local AI, it works completely offline. You don't need an internet connection to record, transcribe, or generate summaries.

## How does Hyprnote route cloud LLM requests?

When using cloud AI (Hyprnote Pro), LLM requests are routed through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). OpenRouter acts as a unified gateway to multiple model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others), so Hyprnote can switch between models without requiring separate API keys for each provider. A single `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is all that's needed for cloud LLM access.

## What is the support chat powered by?

The in-app support chat uses the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to connect to Hyprnote's support server. The MCP server provides tools for GitHub issue management (`search_issues`, `create_issue`, `add_comment`) and Stripe billing operations (`list_subscriptions`, `create_billing_portal_session`). It also serves MCP prompts that guide the chat's behavior. Destructive actions like creating issues require user confirmation before executing.
