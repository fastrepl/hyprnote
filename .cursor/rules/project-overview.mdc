# Hyprnote Project Overview

Hyprnote is an AI-powered meeting notepad that runs **offline and locally**. It's a Tauri-based desktop application designed for privacy-first meeting recording, transcription, and AI-powered summarization.

## Key Features
- Records and transcribes meetings locally
- Generates powerful summaries from raw meeting notes
- Works completely offline using open-source models (Whisper & Llama)
- Local-first architecture for privacy
- Extensible plugin system

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Tauri
- **Backend**: Rust (for core functionality and native plugins)
- **Monorepo Management**: Turbo with pnpm
- **Code Formatting**: dprint (TypeScript/Markdown) + rustfmt (Rust)
- **Database**: SQLite via libsql/Turso
- **Audio Processing**: Custom Rust crates with platform-specific implementations
- **AI/ML**: ONNX runtime, Whisper (local STT), Llama (local LLM)
- **State Management**: Zustand (client) + React Query (server)

## Project Structure
- `apps/desktop/`: Main Tauri desktop application
- `apps/app/`: Web application version (shares code with desktop)
- `crates/`: 47 specialized Rust libraries for core functionality
- `plugins/`: Tauri plugins with TypeScript bindings
- `packages/`: Shared TypeScript packages

## Notable Features
- Real-time audio processing pipeline (capture → VAD → echo cancellation → chunking → STT)
- Multiple STT backends: Whisper (local), Deepgram/Clova (cloud)
- Speaker diarization via Pyannote
- Platform-specific integrations (macOS NSPanel, Apple Calendar, etc.)
- Grammar-based structured LLM output (GBNF)
- Extensible plugin architecture with IPC bridge

## Platform Support
- macOS (public beta)
- Windows (coming soon)
- Linux (planned)
