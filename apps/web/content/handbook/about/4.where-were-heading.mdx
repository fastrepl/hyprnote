Char today is a notetaker. Tomorrow, much more.

**A trusted executive assistant** — Meetings are the entry point. From there: inbox, calendar, follow-ups, workflow. The goal is an AI-native productivity stack that feels as natural as having a world-class assistant by your side.

**A suite of open-source, AI-native tools** — Not just one product, but a family of tools that share the same values: open source, local-first, file-based. Empowering without lock-in.

**Enterprise-ready without losing the soul** — Compliance-ready, deployment-flexible, but still simple and opinionated. We won't become bloatware to win enterprise deals.
