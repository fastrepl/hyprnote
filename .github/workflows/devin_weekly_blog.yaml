            You are tasked with writing the weekly "Hyprnote Weekly" blog post summarizing the past week's development work.

            ## Context
            Hyprnote is a Tauri-based desktop app for AI meeting notes that prioritizes privacy.
            Repository: fastrepl/hyprnote

            ## Your Task
            1. **Analyze Recent Changes**
               - Review git commits from the last 7 days using: `git log --since="7 days ago" --stat --oneline`
               - Review the changelog files in `apps/web/content/changelog/` for any new releases
               - Focus on changes in: crates/, apps/desktop/, apps/web/, packages/, plugins/
               - Pay special attention to:
                 * New features or improvements
                 * Bug fixes
                 * UI/UX changes
                 * Performance improvements
                 * New integrations or providers

            2. **Write the Blog Post**
               Create a new MDX file at `apps/web/content/articles/hyprnote-weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.mdx` where YYYY-MM-DD is today's date.

               Use this frontmatter format:
               ```
               ---
               meta_title: "Hyprnote Weekly: [Brief Summary of Key Changes]"
               display_title: "Hyprnote Weekly: [Month Day, Year]"
               meta_description: "[1-2 sentence summary of the week's highlights]"
               author: "John Jeong"
               published: true
               category: "Hyprnote Weekly"
               date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
               ---
               ```

               Write the post in a narrative style (not bullet points). Group related changes into sections with descriptive headings. Focus on what matters to users:
               - What's new and why it's useful
               - What was fixed and what problem it solves
               - What's coming next (if applicable)

               Keep the tone conversational and technical but accessible. Reference the changelog for specific version numbers when relevant.

            3. **Create a PR**
               - Create a PR with the blog post
               - The PR title should be: "blog(weekly): [date]"
               - Include a summary of what the post covers in the PR description

            ## Important Notes
            - If there are no significant changes this week, still create a brief post noting it was a quiet week
            - Do not include internal refactoring or CI changes unless they have user-facing impact
            - Link to the changelog page at the end: `/changelog`
            - Test that MDX syntax is valid using dprint
