Hyprnote was born from frustration.

**John's sales background** meant living through countless meetings where existing tools transcribed but didn't go further. As a heavy note-taker for over 20 years who has tried every app in the market — Obsidian, Logseq, Apple Notes, and more — he has very specific taste and strong opinions about what a note-taking tool should be.

**Yujong's open-source background** brought the conviction that solutions must be transparent and community-driven. Create massive value first, capture some of it later.

**Together**, we wanted craft and simplicity. Trustworthy, reliable, uncompromising.

## Perfect Timing

LLMs changed everything. Ideas prototype faster, models run locally, hardware keeps improving. On-device AI assistants went from impossible to real.
