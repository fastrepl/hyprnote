summary: "AI should produce artifacts you can own, run locally when possible, and never replace your judgment."

**AI Needs Inspectable Artifacts** — To help humans think, AI needs artifacts humans can own, inspect, move, and understand. Plain text enables collaboration without dependency.

**Legibility Enables Intelligence** — AI and humans thrive with simple, transparent systems. Organized, inspectable structures enable understanding and reasoning.

**Local-First AI** — Hardware advances rapidly. What required cloud now runs on your laptop. On-device AI gives speed, privacy, and independence from subscriptions.

**The Human Remains Central** — AI reduces cognitive load, not replaces judgment. Always see what's happening, always override.

**Model Agnosticism** — No lock-in to our models. Bring your own, use local, mix and match. Intelligence layer as flexible as data layer.
