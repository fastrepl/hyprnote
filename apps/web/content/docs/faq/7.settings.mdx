The settings file is located at:

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/settings.json
```

You can edit this file directly, but changes only take effect after restarting Char. For most settings, use the in-app Settings panel instead.

## Timezone

Char detects your system timezone automatically. If you need to override it (e.g., you travel frequently or your system clock is wrong), go to **Settings** > **General** and select a timezone from the searchable dropdown. The chosen timezone controls how session timestamps appear in the sidebar timeline.

## Week Start Day

Under **Settings** > **General**, the **Week starts on** option lets you choose the first day of the week in the calendar view. You can pick **System** (follows your locale), **Sunday**, or **Monday**.

## Mic Active Threshold

Under **Settings** > **Notification**, the **Mic Active Threshold** slider lets you configure how long (5–120 seconds) a meeting app like Zoom or Google Meet must be using your microphone before Char sends a reminder notification to start recording. This replaces the previous Lab toggle and gives you finer control over when the reminder fires.
