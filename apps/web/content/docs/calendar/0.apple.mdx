## Need help or want to report an issue?

If you're experiencing issues with Apple Calendar integration or have suggestions for improvement, please [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues/new?labels=calendar%3Aapple).


## How often does Hyprnote sync with Apple Calendar?

Hyprnote syncs with Apple Calendar **every 60 seconds** automatically. Additionally, sync is triggered immediately when:

- You enable or disable a calendar
- Changes are detected in your Apple Calendar app (via system notifications)
- You manually refresh calendars using the refresh button

When you toggle calendars on or off, changes are debounced for 5 seconds to avoid excessive syncing.

## What date range of events does Hyprnote sync?

Hyprnote syncs events from **7 days ago** to **30 days in the future**. This ensures you have recent past events for context and upcoming events for planning.

Events outside this range remain in your database but won't be actively synced unless they fall back into this window.
