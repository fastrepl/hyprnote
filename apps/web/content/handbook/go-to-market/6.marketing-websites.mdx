We build standalone marketing websites to reach people searching for specific problems. Each site focuses on one pain point and connects it to Hyprnote.

## Why Standalone Sites

Single-topic sites rank better for specific searches. Someone googling "meetings suck" finds a page that speaks directly to their frustration, not a generic product page.

## Our Marketing Sites

| Site | Focus | Repo |
|------|-------|------|
| [meetingsucks.com](https://meetingsucks.com) | Why meetings are broken | [fastrepl/meetingsucks](https://github.com/fastrepl/meetingsucks) |

## How We Build Them

Each site follows a similar pattern:

- **Astro** for fast static generation
- **Netlify** for hosting and deployment
- **Dark theme** with bold typography
- **Humorous, relatable copy** that speaks to real pain
- **Clear CTA** to Hyprnote

Inspired by sites like [loggingsucks.com](https://loggingsucks.com) and [isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com](https://www.isgoogleanalyticsillegal.com/).

## Adding New Sites

When building a new marketing site:

1. Create repo under `fastrepl/` org
2. Use Astro with the established dark theme
3. Write copy that's genuinely funny and relatable
4. Include clear CTAs to hyprnote.com
5. Add to this handbook page
6. Deploy via Netlify
