## not

This might **NOT** be a good fit if:

- You only want to design in Figma
- You prefer mockups over shipping
- You skip quality to move fast
- You need process to make progress
- You don't want to do marketing
- You want a short-term role

## why

Hyprnote is product-led. Design execution is our bottleneck - visual quality depends too much on the founder. We need someone to own design across product and marketing.

Some context: 38% week-5 retention, 30% WoW DAU growth, 9.2% web conversion, 7.4k GitHub stars, 10% MoM MRR growth - all organically. <AnimatedJobText text="We're not stopping here - this is just the start." className="text-neutral-400" />

Small team. High trust. Craft over hype.

## what

Own visual quality across product, website, and marketing. Design and ship real UI. Create assets for launches and content. Build a design system that actually gets used.

Success: the product feels calmer, marketing doesn't wait on the founder, design decisions feel obvious.

## who

A designer who codes and ships. Fast, independent, uncompromising on quality. Interested in marketing and storytelling. Prefers responsibility over rigid scope.

## how

Remote-first. Async via <ToolIcon icon="logos:slack-icon" /> Slack, occasional calls. Everything runs through <ToolIcon icon="logos:github-icon" /> GitHub.

You must be comfortable with <ToolIcon icon="logos:figma" /> Figma, a code editor, and basic video editing.

## compensation

Ballpark: $80–120k/year, 0.5–1.5% equity. Depends on scope and experience.

Early, high-ownership role. You'll grow with the company.
