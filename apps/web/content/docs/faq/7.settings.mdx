The settings file is located at:

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/hyprnote/settings.json
```

You can edit this file directly, but changes only take effect after restarting Hyprnote. For most settings, use the in-app Settings panel instead.

## Timezone

You can manually configure your timezone in **Settings** > **General**. This controls how timestamps are displayed in the sidebar timeline and session metadata. By default, Hyprnote uses your system timezone.
