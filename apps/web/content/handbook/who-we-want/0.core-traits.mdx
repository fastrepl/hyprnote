summary: "The three core traits we value most in teammates: Grit, Intellectual honesty, and Sharpness."

## 1. Grit

Building a startup is hard. There will be moments of doubt, frustration, and exhaustion. We need people who push through — not blindly, but with resilience and purpose. Grit means staying committed to the mission even when progress feels slow.

## 2. Intellectual Honesty

We value people who can say "I don't know" or "I was wrong." Ego has no place here. We want teammates who seek truth over being right, who challenge ideas constructively, and who update their views when presented with better evidence.

## 3. Sharpness

Speed matters. We look for people who think quickly, communicate clearly, and execute decisively. Sharpness isn't about being the smartest — it's about being effective under pressure and making good decisions fast.
