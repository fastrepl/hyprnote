Hyprnote is more than an AI notepad — it’s a tool to think clearly, capture conversations, and stay in control of your information.

This roadmap highlights the key areas we’re improving. It reflects what we believe matters most: privacy, performance, and real-world usability.

These are the core pillars we’re focused on.

### 1. Editor

Building the fastest, cleanest writing experience. We’re focusing on speed, structure, and minimal friction when jotting thoughts.

### 2. Transcript

Improving diarization, accuracy, and multi-language support. Goal: you can trust the transcript like it was written by a human.

#### 3. Summary

Making summaries sharper, more contextual, and controllable. We want your highlights to feel like they were written by you on your best day.

#### 4. Notifications

You’ll be notified just when it matters — think silent but smart. We’re experimenting with real-time meeting cues and after-call nudges.

#### 5. Search

Blazing-fast and contextual. We’re working on semantic search, filters, and scoped queries so you never lose a thought again.

#### 6. AI Chat

Chat with your notes like a research assistant. Coming soon: better memory, topic linking, and action suggestions based on past meetings.

#### 7. Finder

Think Spotlight for your meetings. One place to quickly surface notes, files, and topics without breaking flow.

#### 8. Integration

You’ll be able to plug Hyprnote into your stack. Focused on offline-friendly, API-first, and secure integrations with calendars, CRMs, and more.

#### 9. Extensions

You'll be able to extend your experience in Hyprnote with extensions — just like Chrome or Obsidian. Not only this, but be able to build custom workflows that runs on your behalf.
