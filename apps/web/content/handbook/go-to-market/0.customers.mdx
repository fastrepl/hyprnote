People who believe they deserve better than vendor lock-in and subscription treadmills.

## Prosumers First

If we had to pick one target audience, it would be developers. We're devs ourselves, and every value we hold comes from loving dev tools and products that devs love. The more dev-related taste someone has, the more appealing Char becomes for them.

We're seeing validation — users from well-known tech companies are joining our community.

## What Our Customers Care About

**Autonomy** — Choose your own AI models, on-device or cloud. Many already have API credits and wonder why they should pay twice when they can bring their own key.

**Data ownership** — Their notes stay theirs, not training data. They understand local-first.

**Open source** — Value transparency and extensibility. Part of the open source community because it aligns with how they think software should be built.

## How We Talk to Them

Honesty and clarity. No marketing fluff, no overpromising. We say what we do well and where we're still improving.

- Be direct — say what we mean
- Be helpful — solve problems, don't sell features
- Be responsive — every piece of feedback is valuable
- Be transparent — share our roadmap, acknowledge limitations
