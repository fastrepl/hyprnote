# Hyprnote (https://hyprnote.com)

Hyprnote is a private, on-device AI notepad designed for people who want agency over how they capture and understand information. Unlike meeting bots, Hyprnote never joins calls or announces itself. You take notes in a notepad you control, and the AI enhances, structures, and deepens your thinking while keeping all data local by default. Hyprnote helps you build a durable personal knowledge base that can optionally flow into tools like Notion or Confluence.
