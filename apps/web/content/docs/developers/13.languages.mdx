## Notes

- **Whisper** runs locally on your device. OpenAI and Fireworks use Whisper-based models, so they share the same language coverage.
- **Deepgram** uses Nova-3 by default. Some languages (e.g., Chinese, Thai) are only available on Nova-2.
- **AssemblyAI** streaming supports fewer languages (English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese) than batch transcription shown above.
- **Soniox** supports all listed languages for both real-time and batch transcription.
- **Gladia** has the widest cloud provider coverage, supporting nearly all Whisper languages.
- **ElevenLabs** additionally supports some languages not listed here (e.g., Oriya, Kyrgyz, Irish, Igbo, Kurdish, Xhosa, Zulu).

## Configuration

Set your main language and additional spoken languages in Settings > Language & Vocabulary. The main language is used for AI responses; spoken languages improve transcription accuracy in multilingual meetings.
