## Why MDX + GitHub

Files endure, interfaces change. The same philosophy that shapes Hyprnote shapes how we run the company.

Content lives as MDX files in Git — not locked in a proprietary database.

* **Ownership** — Plain text we control, not opaque blobs behind an API
* **Durability** — Markdown outlasts any CMS platform
* **Transparency** — Version-controlled and inspectable
* **Friction-free** — Edit, push, done

We eat our own cooking. If users' notes should be files they own, our company content should be too.
