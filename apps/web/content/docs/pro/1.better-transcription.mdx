Pro includes access to premium cloud transcription services that offer higher accuracy than local models, especially for accented speech, technical jargon, and noisy environments.

## Pro Curated Models

Pro subscribers get access to curated cloud transcription models that work out of the box with no configuration required. These models are selected for quality and reliability, and API keys are managed automatically.

## Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

If you want to use a specific transcription provider, you can bring your own API key. Supported providers include:

| Provider | Best For | Languages |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Deepgram | Real-time accuracy, keyword handling | 30+ |
| AssemblyAI | Speaker diarization, streaming | 20+ |
| Gladia | Code switching, multi-channel audio | 90+ |
| OpenAI | Batch transcription, Whisper API | 50+ |
| Soniox | High accuracy, enterprise features | 70+ |
| ElevenLabs | High-quality real-time transcription | 30+ |
| DashScope | Qwen3-ASR real-time speech recognition | 10+ |
| Mistral | Voxtral audio transcription | 10+ |

To use BYOK, go to Settings > Transcription and enter your API key for your preferred provider.

## How to Enable

1. Subscribe to Pro or start a free trial
2. Go to Settings > Transcription
3. Use the curated Pro models (default) or enter your own API key for a specific provider

## Language Support

Char checks if your selected provider supports your configured languages. If there's a mismatch, you'll see a warning with suggestions for compatible providers. Configure your languages in Settings > Language & Vocabulary.

## How Your Audio Data Is Handled

When using cloud transcription, your recorded audio is sent to the selected provider for processing:

- **Pro curated models:** Your audio is proxied through `pro.hyprnote.com` and forwarded to a curated STT provider. The proxy does not store your audio.
- **BYOK:** Your audio is sent directly from your device to the provider you selected. Char acts only as the client.

Your audio files and transcripts are always stored locally on your device regardless of which transcription method you use. Cloud providers only receive the audio stream for processing and return the transcript.

For the full details on every data flow, see [AI Models & Data Privacy](/docs/faq/ai-models-and-privacy).

## When to Use Cloud vs Local

Use cloud transcription when you need maximum accuracy and have internet access. Use local transcription (Whisper models) when privacy is paramount or you're offline. Local models support 50+ languages and run entirely on your device.

For local STT model details and manual download instructions, see [Local Models](/docs/developers/local-models).
