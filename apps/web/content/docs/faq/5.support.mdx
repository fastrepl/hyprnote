## How do I get help if something isn't working?

The fastest way to get help is through the **in-app support chat**. Click your profile icon in the sidebar and select **Report Bug** or **Suggest Feature** to open a support conversation. The chat automatically collects your device information and can submit bug reports or feature requests directly. It can also search existing GitHub issues and discussions to check whether your problem has already been reported or addressed.

You can also reach us through our Discord community or by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastrepl/hyprnote/issues).

## Do you offer refunds?

Yes, we offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied with Hyprnote Pro, contact us within 30 days of purchase for a full refund.
