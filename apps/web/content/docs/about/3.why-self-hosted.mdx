section: "About"
description: "Why the heck would you want to self-host Hyprnote? Because you can, and because it gives you control over your data and privacy."
---

Self-hosting gives you complete control over your data and infrastructure. No third-party servers, no data leaks.

## Benefits

**Data Control**: Your notes stay on your infrastructure. You decide where data lives and who can access it.

**Privacy**: Keep sensitive meeting content away from external services entirely.

**Customization**: Modify the codebase, add features, and integrate with your existing tools.

## Getting Started

Self-hosting documentation is coming soon. For now, see the [developer setup guide](/docs/developers/setup) to run Hyprnote from source.
