Bottoms-up, product-led growth (PLG) is the right playbook for Char. End users need to advocate for the product inside their companies. The best way into organizations is through individual users who love it and champion it internally.

Being open source gives us this advantage — it's how products like PostHog and Vercel made their way into the market.

## How People Find Us

**High-intent channels** — SEO, Reddit, LinkedIn. People actively searching for solutions.

**Social proof** — X, TikTok, word of mouth. Trust from respected voices.

**Organic** — Open source presence, GitHub stars, personal recommendations.

We invest in maintaining presence across all three.

## Ideal User Journey

1. Onboarding window pops up — first impression matters
2. User signs up (though we offer an option to start without logging in)
3. Grants microphone and calendar permissions
4. Main window appears — user sees the core product
5. Pro trial starts immediately — shortening time-to-value is critical

The key: minimize friction, maximize the speed at which users experience value.

## Enterprise — Later

Enterprise focus comes after we've built a strong base of individual advocates who can champion Char within their organizations.
