Hyprnote is the first open-source AI notetaker for the enterprise, designed with a privacy-first, local-first philosophy. At its core, Hyprnote is more than just a notetaker — it's the beginning of an AI-native executive assistant.

## Reducing Cognitive Load

Note-taking reduces cognitive load. We're extending that idea: what other cognitive burdens can we offload to software? Our vision is for Hyprnote to take care of your notes today, and in the future, your email, calendar, and broader workflow — giving you the experience of having someone trustworthy "taking care of things" on your behalf.

## Simple and Accessible

Hyprnote is simple, accessible, and platform-agnostic. Like Apple Notes, but built for meetings. Like an assistant that not only records but also understands and organizes what matters.
